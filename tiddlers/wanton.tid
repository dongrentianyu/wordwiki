Common in Old and Middle English, still present in 18c. glossaries of Scottish and Northern English; this word is its sole modern survival. Second element is Middle English towen, from Old English togen, past participle of teon ""to train, discipline;"" literally ""to pull, draw,"" from Proto-Germanic *teuhan (cognates: Old High German ziohan ""to pull;"" see tug (v.)). The basic notion perhaps is ""ill-bred, poorly brought up;"" compare German ungezogen ""ill-bred, rude, haughty,"" literally ""unpulled."" Especially of sexual indulgence from late 14c. Meaning ""inhumane, merciless"" is from 1510s. Related: Wantonly; wantonness. As Flies to wanton Boyes are we to th' Gods, They kill vs for their sport. [Shakespeare, ""Lear,"" 1605]  wanton (n.)
