""stamp-collecting,"" 1865, from French philatélie, coined by French stamp collector Georges Herpin (in ""Le Collectionneur de Timbres-poste,"" Nov. 15, 1864), from Greek phil- ""loving"" (see philo-) + ateleia ""exemption from tax,"" the closest word Herpin could find in ancient Greek to the concept of ""postage stamp"" (from a- ""without"" + telos ""tax;"" see toll (n.)). A reminder of the original function of postage stamps, now often forgotten: the cost of letter-carrying formerly was paid by the recipient; stamps indicated it had been pre-paid by the sender, thus the letters were ""carriage-free."" It is a pity that for one of the most popular scientific pursuits one of the least popularly intelligible names should have been found. [Fowler] Stampomania (1865) also was tried. Stamp-collecting is from 1862. Related: Philatelic; philatelism; philatelist."
