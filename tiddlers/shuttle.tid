"v. (使)穿梭移动，往返运送 无 无 无 shuttle (n.)  Old English scytel ""a dart, arrow,"" from Proto-Germanic *skutilaz (cognates: Old Norse skutill ""harpoon""), from PIE *skeud- ""to shoot, to chase, to throw, to project"" (see shoot (v.)). The original sense in English is obsolete; the weaving instrument so called (mid-14c.) from being ""shot"" across the threads. Sense of ""train that runs back and forth"" is first recorded 1895, from image of the weaver's instrument's back-and-forth movement over the warp; extended to aircraft 1942, to spacecraft 1969. In some other languages, the weaving instrument takes its name from its resemblance to a boat (Latin navicula, French navette, German weberschiff).  shuttle (v.)  1550s, ""move rapidly to and fro,"" from shuttle (n.); sense of ""transport via a shuttle service"" is recorded from 1930.
