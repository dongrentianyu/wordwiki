Sense of ""commoner who cultivates his land"" is recorded from early 15c.; also the third order of fighting men (late 14c., below knights and squires, above knaves), hence yeomen's service ""good, efficient service"" (c.1600). Meaning ""naval petty officer in charge of supplies"" is first attested 1660s. Yeowoman first recorded 1852: ""Then I am yeo-woman O the clumsy word!"" [Tennyson, ""The Foresters""]"
