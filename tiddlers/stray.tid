On another theory, the Old French word is from Vulgar Latin *estragare, a contraction of *estravagare, representing Latin extra vagari ""to wander outside"" (see extravagant). Figurative sense of ""to wander from the path of rectitude"" is attested from early 14c. Related: Strayed; straying. stray (n.)  ""domestic animal found wandering,"" early 13c., from Anglo-French noun use of Old French estraié ""strayed, riderless,"" past participle adjective from estraier ""to roam, drift, run loose"" (see stray (v.)). stray (adj.)  c.1600, of animals; 19c. of persons and things, from stray (n.) and in part a shortening of astray."
