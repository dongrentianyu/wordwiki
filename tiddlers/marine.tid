The Old English word was sælic. marine (n.)  14c., ""seacoast;"" see marine (adj.). Meaning ""collective shipping of a country"" is from 1660s. Meaning ""soldier who serves on a ship"" is from 1670s, a separate borrowing from French marine, from the French adjective. Phrase tell that to the marines (1806) originally was the first half of a retort expressing skepticism: ""Upon my soul, sir,"" answered the lieutenant, ""when I thought she scorned my passion, I wept like a child."" ""Belay there!"" cried the captain; ""you may tell that to the marines, but I'll be d----d if the sailors will believe it."" [""John Moore,"" ""The Post-Captain; or, the Wooden Walls Well Manned,"" 1805] The book, a rollicking sea romance/adventure novel, was popular in its day and the remark is a recurring punch line in it (repeated at least four times). It was written by naval veteran John Davis (1774-1854) but published under the name John Moore. Walsh records that, ""The marines are among the 'jolly' jack-tars a proverbially gullible lot, capable of swallowing any yarn, in size varying from a yawl-boat to a full-rigged frigate."""
