"n./v.脸红；奔流；冲洗 【英】 n./v. 脸红(to become red in the face; blush)；奔流, 冲洗(to flow and spread suddenly and rapidly) 【考】 galvanize : stimulate / irrigate : flush(通电刺激是刺激/冲 洗伤口是冲洗) 【记】 和blush(脸红)一起记 ，flush 作为'冲洗'一义，可 能来自flow(流动)一 词的变体 【例】 The stream was flushing after the heavy rain. n. /v. 冲刷(以快速水流冲净, 如冲水马桶); (因发烧、窘迫或强烈的感情而)脸红 = blush 【记】flu冲, sh: 自己想! 【参】blush(v/n 脸红) 【类】galvanize: stimulate = irrigate: flush 电击是刺激 = 冲洗伤口是冲洗 【记】flow flu 流 + sh 湿，水，或者sh__ →上厕所冲水→冲；上厕所使劲时憋的脸红 【相关】blush 脸红，拼音: 不 + lush相同音的中文→便秘憋的也会导致→脸红 flush (v.)  ""fly up suddenly,"" c.1300, perhaps imitative of the sound of beating wings, or related to flash via its variant flushe. Probably not connected to Old French flux, source of flush (n.). Transitive meaning ""to cause to fly, start"" is first attested mid-15c. The sense of ""spurt, rush out suddenly, flow with force"" (1540s) is probably the same word, with the connecting notion being ""sudden movement,"" but its senses seem more to fit the older ones of flash (now all transferred to this word except in flash flood). Meaning ""cleanse a drain, etc., with a rush of water"" is from 1789. The noun sense of ""sudden redness in the face"" (1620s) probably belongs here, too. The verb in this sense is from 1660s. ""A very puzzling word"" [Weekley]. Related: Flushed; flushing. flush (adj.)  1550s, ""perfect, faultless;"" c.1600, ""abundant; plentifully supplied (with money, etc.),"" perhaps from flush (v.) through the notion of a river running full, hence level with its banks. Meaning ""even, level"" is from 1620s. flush (n.)  ""hand of cards all of one suit,"" 1520s, perhaps from Middle French flus (15c.), from Old French flux ""a flowing,"" with the sense of ""a run"" (of cards), from Latin fluxus ""flux,"" from fluere ""to flow"" (see fluent). The form in English probably was influenced by flush (v.)."
