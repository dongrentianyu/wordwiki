"n. 台风 【英】 n. 台风(tropical hurricane or cyclone) 无 【记】音:台风 typhoon (n.)  Tiphon ""violent storm, whirlwind, tornado,"" 1550s, from Greek typhon ""whirlwind,"" personified as a giant, father of the winds, perhaps from typhein ""to smoke"" (see typhus), but according to Watkins from PIE *dheub- ""deep, hollow,"" via notion of ""monster from the depths."" The meaning ""cyclone, violent hurricane of India or the China Seas"" is first recorded 1588 in Thomas Hickock's translation of an account in Italian of a voyage to the East Indies by Caesar Frederick, a merchant of Venice: concerning which Touffon ye are to vnderstand, that in the East Indies often times, there are not stormes as in other countreys; but euery 10. or 12. yeeres there are such tempests and stormes, that it is a thing incredible, but to those that haue seene it, neither do they know certainly what yeere they wil come. [""The voyage and trauell of M. Caesar Fredericke, Marchant of Venice, into the East India, and beyond the Indies""] This sense of the word, in reference to titanic storms in the East Indies, first appears in Europe in Portuguese in the mid-16th century. It aparently is from tufan, a word in Arabic, Persian, and Hindi meaning ""big cyclonic storm."" Yule [""Hobson-Jobson,"" London, 1903] writes that ""the probability is that Vasco [da Gama] and his followers got the tufao ... direct from the Arab pilots."" The Arabic word sometimes is said to be from Greek typhon, but other sources consider it purely Semitic, though the Greek word might have influenced the form of the word in English. Al-tufan occurs several times in the Koran for ""a flood or storm"" and also for Noah's Flood. Chinese (Cantonese) tai fung ""a great wind"" also might have influenced the form or sense of the word in English, and that term and the Indian one may have had some mutual influence; toofan still means ""big storm"" in India."
