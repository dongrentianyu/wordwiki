"v.拖延议事，设置障碍 【英】 v. 拖延议事，设置障碍( intentionally delay in a discussion or argument) 【考】 反义词：cooperate fully(完全合作) 【例】 He was stonewalling and everybody knew it.(他在阻碍议事,每 人都能看出来) v. 拖延; 拒绝(回答...或与...合作) = rebuff 【记】stone石头, wall墙: 在你面前竪起石头墙－拒绝 【反】cooperate fully(完全合作) 【记】stone + wall stonewall (n.)  also stone wall, Old English stanwalle; see stone (n.) + wall (n.). As nickname of Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson (1824-1863), bestowed 1861 on the occasion of the First Battle of Bull Run, supposedly by Gen. Bernard Bee, urging his brigade to rally around Jackson, who was ""standing like a stone wall."" Bee was killed in the battle; the account of the nickname appeared in Southern newspapers within four days of the battle. On the face of it this account has no character of authenticity, and the words ascribed to Bee smack less of the battlefield than of the editorial sanctum. ... It seems inherently probable that something was said by somebody, during or immediately after the battle, that likened Jackson or his men or both to a stone wall. [R.M. Johnston, ""Bull Run: Its Strategy and Tactics,"" Boston, 1913]  stonewall (v.)  ""to obstruct,"" 1889 in sports; 1914 in politics, from metaphoric use of stone wall (n.) for ""act of obstruction"" (1876). Related: Stonewalled; stonewalling (defined in Century Dictionary as ""parliamentary obstruction by talking against time, raising technical objections, etc.,"" and identified as originally Australian)."
