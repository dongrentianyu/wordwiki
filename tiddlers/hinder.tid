Old English hindrian ""to harm, injure, impair, check, repress,"" from Proto-Germanic *hinderojan (cognates: Old Norse hindra, Dutch hinderen, Old High German hintaron, German hindern ""to keep back""), from a root meaning ""on that side of, behind"" (see hind (adj.)); thus the ground sense is ""to put or keep back,"" though this sense in English is recorded only from late 14c. Related: Hindered; hindering. hinder (adj,)  ""situated in the rear, toward the back,"" late 14c., probably from Old English hinder (adv.)
