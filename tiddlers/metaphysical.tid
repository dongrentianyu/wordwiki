title:metaphysical

"a.形而上学的，玄学的 无 无 无 metaphysical (adj.)  early 15c., ""pertaining to metaphysics,"" from methaphesik (late 14c.) + -al, and in part from Medieval Latin metaphysicalis, from Medieval Latin metaphysica (see metaphysics). It came to be used in the sense of ""abstract, speculative"" (among others by Johnson, who applied it to certain 17c. poets, notably Donne and Cowley, who used ""witty conceits"" and abstruse imagery). Related: Metaphysically."
