He was a rather good looking <u>yellow boy</u>. </p><p><i>yellow man—</i>1. <i>(Anthropology)</i> a person of the Mongoloid race with naturally yellowish skin: Mongolic or <u>Yellow Man</u> prevails over the vast area lying east of a line drawn from Lapland to Siam. 2. <i>(coll.)</i> a fearful, cowardly man: It frightens me when moderate voices are taken to be from weak and <u>yellow men</u>. 3. a flat sugar-stick, flavored with lemon: “Lemon Platt,” commonly sold as “<u>Yellow Man</u>” at fairs in the North of Ireland, derives its name from its flavor.</p> </entry>
