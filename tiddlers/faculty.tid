title:faculty

"n.全体教员；一个教育机构的认教人员，有时也包括行政人员在内。 无 无 无 faculty (n.)  late 14c., ""ability, means, resources,"" from Old French faculté (14c.) ""skill, accomplishment, learning,"" and directly from Latin facultatem (nominative facultas) ""power, ability, wealth,"" from *facli-tat-s, from facilis (see facile). Academic sense ""branch of knowledge"" probably was the earliest in English (attested in Anglo-Latin from late 12c.), on notion of ""ability in knowledge."" Originally each department was a faculty; the use in reference to the whole teaching staff of a college dates from 1767."
