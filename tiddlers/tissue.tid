The biological sense is first recorded 1831, from French, introduced c.1800 by French anatomist Marie-François-Xavier Bichal (1771-1802). Meaning ""piece of absorbent paper used as a handkerchief"" is from 1929. Tissue-paper is from 1777, supposedly so called because it was made to be placed between tissues to protect them."
