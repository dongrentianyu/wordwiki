"n.橡树 无 无 【记】音形均近似于acorn 橡树果, 橡子，oak本身就是结橡树果acorn的 oak (n.)  Old English ac ""oak tree,"" from Proto-Germanic *aiks (cognates: Old Norse eik, Old Saxon and Old Frisian ek, Middle Dutch eike, Dutch eik, Old High German eih, German Eiche), of uncertain origin with no certain cognates outside Germanic. The usual Indo-European base for ""oak"" (*deru-) has become Modern English tree (n.); likewise in Greek and Celtic words for ""oak"" are from the Indo-European root for ""tree,"" probably reflecting the importance of the oak to ancient Indo-Europeans. The Old Norse form was eik, but as there were no oaks in Iceland the word came to be used there for ""tree"" in general. Used in Biblical translations to render Hebrew elah (probably usually ""terebinth tree"") and four other words."
