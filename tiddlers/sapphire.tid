"n.青石，蓝宝石；a.天蓝色的 【英】 n. 青石，蓝宝石(clear, bright blue jewel)；adj.天蓝色的(deep-b lue) 【例】 a sapphire brooch(蓝宝石的别针 ) n. 蓝宝石(透明的坚硬钢玉, 通常为蓝色, 也可能是除红色以外的任何颜色); adj 天蓝色的 【记】sap(n 树液), p, hire雇佣: 雇佣人把树液中加入蓝色素－蓝宝石 【记】sap + fire 树液之火，烧出来结晶是蓝宝石 sapphire (n.)  ""precious stone next in hardness to a diamond,"" mid-13c., from Old French saphir (12c.) and directly from Latin sapphirus (source also of Spanish zafir, Italian zaffiro), from Greek sappheiros ""blue stone"" (the gem meant apparently was not the one that now has the name, but perhaps rather ""lapis lazuli,"" the modern sapphire being perhaps signified by Greek hyakinthos), from a Semitic source (compare Hebrew sappir ""sapphire""), but probably not ultimately from Semitic. Some linguists propose an origin in Sanskrit sanipriya, a dark precious stone (perhaps sapphire or emerald), literally ""sacred to Saturn,"" from Sani ""Saturn"" + priyah ""precious."" In Renaissance lapidaries, it was said to cure anger and stupidity. As an adjective from early 15c. Related: Sapphiric; sapphirine."
