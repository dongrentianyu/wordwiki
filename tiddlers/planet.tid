"n.行星 【英】 n. 行星 (a large body in space that moves round a star) 无 无 planet (n.)  late Old English planete, from Old French planete (Modern French planète), from Late Latin planeta, from Greek planetes, from (asteres) planetai ""wandering (stars),"" from planasthai ""to wander,"" of unknown origin, possibly from PIE *pele- (2) ""flat, to spread"" on notion of ""spread out."" So called because they have apparent motion, unlike the ""fixed"" stars. Originally including also the moon and sun; modern scientific sense of ""world that orbits a star"" is from 1630s."
