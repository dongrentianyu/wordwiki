"n. 沙文主义，盲目爱国主义 【英】 n. 沙文主义，盲目爱国 主义 (fanatic patriotism; jingoism) 【记】 来自一剧中人名：Cha uvin，因其过分的爱 国主义和对拿破仑的 忠诚而闻名； n. 沙文主义(狂热的盲目爱国主义) = patriotism = jingoism 【例】male chauvinism 大男子主义 【源】源自尼古拉斯?沙文(Nicolas Chauvin), 传说中因其过分的爱国主义和对拿破仑的忠诚而闻名的法国士兵; 【记】译音：沙文主义，大国沙文主义 chauvinism (n.)  1840, ""exaggerated, blind patriotism,"" from French chauvinisme (1839), from the character Nicholas Chauvin, soldier of Napoleon's Grand Armee, notoriously attached to the Empire long after it was history, in the Cogniards' popular 1831 vaudeville ""La Cocarde Tricolore."" Meaning extended to ""sexism"" via male chauvinism (1969). The name is a French form of Latin Calvinus and thus Calvinism and chauvinism are, etymologically, twins. The name was a common one in Napoleon's army, and if there was a real person at the base of the character in the play, he has not been certainly identified by etymologists, though memoirs of Waterloo (one published in Paris in 1822) mention ""one of our principal piqueurs, named Chauvin, who had returned with Napoleon from Elba,"" which implies loyalty."
