"n. 兰花；称赞 【例】 An un-sung editor deserves some of the orchids. 无 【记】orchard 果园里头有兰花，orchard 是yard, garden；or 反 + chide 责骂→责骂的反意→赞扬 【相关】chide 责骂 orchid (n.)  1845, introduced by John Lindley in ""School Botanty,"" from Modern Latin Orchideæ (Linnaeus), the plant's family name, from Latin orchis, a kind of orchid, from Greek orkhis (genitive orkheos) ""orchid,"" literally ""testicle,"" from PIE *orghi-, the standard root for ""testicle"" (cognates: Avestan erezi ""testicles,"" Armenian orjik, Middle Irish uirgge, Irish uirge ""testicle,"" Lithuanian erzilas ""stallion""). The plant so called because of the shape of its root. Earlier in English in Latin form, orchis (1560s), and in Middle English it was ballockwort (c.1300; see ballocks). Marred by extraneous -d- in an attempt to extract the Latin stem."
