title:choice

"a.上等的；精选的 无 无 无 choice (n.)  mid-14c., ""that which is choice,"" from choice (adj.) blended with earlier chois (n.) ""action of selecting"" (c.1300); ""power of choosing"" (early 14c.), ""someone or something chosen"" (late 14c.), from Old French chois ""one's choice; fact of having a choice"" (12c., Modern French choix), from verb choisir ""to choose, distinguish, discern; recognize, perceive, see,"" from a Germanic source related to Old English ceosan ""to choose, taste, try;"" see choose. Late Old English chis ""fastidious, choosy,"" from or related to ceosan, probably also contributed to the development of choice.  Replaced Old English cyre ""choice, free will,"" from the same base, probably because the imported word was closer to choose [see note in OED]. choice (adj.)  ""worthy to be chosen, distinguished, excellent,"" mid-14c., from choice (n.). Related: Choiceness."
