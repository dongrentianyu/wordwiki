title:muscle

"n.肌肉；肌肉的力量 无 无 无 muscle (n.)  late 14c., from Middle French muscle ""muscle, sinew"" (14c.) and directly from Latin musculus ""a muscle,"" literally ""little mouse,"" diminutive of mus ""mouse"" (see mouse (n.)). So called because the shape and movement of some muscles (notably biceps) were thought to resemble mice. The analogy was made in Greek, too, where mys is both ""mouse"" and ""muscle,"" and its comb. form gives the medical prefix myo-. Compare also Old Church Slavonic mysi ""mouse,"" mysica ""arm;"" German Maus ""mouse; muscle,"" Arabic 'adalah ""muscle,"" 'adal ""field mouse."" In Middle English, lacerte, from the Latin word for ""lizard,"" also was used as a word for a muscle. Musclez & lacertez bene one selfe þing, Bot þe muscle is said to þe fourme of mouse & lacert to þe fourme of a lizard. [Guy de Chauliac, ""Grande Chirurgie,"" c.1425] Hence muscular and mousy are relatives, and a Middle English word for ""muscular"" was lacertous, ""lizardy."" Figurative sense of ""force, violence, threat of violence"" is 1930, American English. Muscle car ""hot rod"" is from 1969. muscle (v.)  1913, ""to accomplish by strength,"" from muscle (n.). Related: Muscled; muscling. To muscle in is 1929 in underworld slang."
