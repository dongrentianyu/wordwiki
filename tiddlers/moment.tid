"n.瞬间；重要 【考】 反义词：insignifica nce(不重要) n. 关键时刻; 重要性 【参】momentary(adj 瞬间的) 【反】insignificance(n 无意义) 无 moment (n.)  mid-14c., ""very brief portion of time, instant,"" in moment of time, from Old French moment (12c.) ""moment, minute; importance, weight, value"" or directly from Latin momentum ""movement, motion; moving power; alteration, change;"" also ""short time, instant"" (also source of Spanish, Italian momento), contraction of *movimentum, from movere ""to move"" (see move (v.)). Some (but not OED) explain the sense evolution of the Latin word by notion of a particle so small it would just ""move"" the pointer of a scale, which led to the transferred sense of ""minute time division."" Sense of ""importance, 'weight' "" is attested in English from 1520s. Phrase never a dull moment first recorded 1889 in Jerome K. Jerome's ""Three Men in a Boat."" Phrase moment of truth first recorded 1932 in Hemingway's ""Death in the Afternoon,"" from Spanish el momento de la verdad, the final sword-thrust in a bull-fight."
