title:orotund

"adj. (声音)宏亮的；夸张的 【英】 adj. (声音)宏亮的(strong and deep; resonant)；夸张的(bombastic or pompous) 【记】 oro(嘴)+tund(=round 圆的)→把嘴张圆→宏 亮的 adj. (声音)宏亮的; 夸张的 【记】oro = ora说, 嘴, tund = round圆的一嘴张圆一宏亮的 【记】源自round；O 象张开的嘴 + 去掉t就是round，指张开嘴大声说话；ora 嘴 + round orotund (adj.)  1792, from Latin ore rotundo ""in well-rounded phrases,"" literally ""with round mouth"" (see ore rotundo). The odd thing about the word is that its only currency, at least in its non-technical sense, is among those who should most abhor it, the people of sufficient education to realize its bad formation; it is at once a monstrosity in its form & a pedantry in its use. [Fowler]"
