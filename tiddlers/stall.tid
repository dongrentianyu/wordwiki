"v.使停止，使延迟 无 无 无 stall (n.1)  ""place in a stable for animals,"" Old English steall ""standing place, position, state; place where cattle are kept, fishing ground,"" from Proto-Germanic *stalla- (cognates: Old Norse stallr ""pedestal for idols, altar; crib, manger,"" Old Frisian stal, Old High German stall ""stand, place, stable, stall,"" German Stall ""stable,"" Stelle ""place""), from PIE root *stel- ""to put, stand,"" with derivatives referring to a standing object or place (cognates: Greek stele ""standing block, slab,"" stellein ""to set in order, arrange, array, equip, make ready;"" Latin stolidus ""insensible, dull, brutish,"" properly ""unmovable""). Meaning ""partially enclosed seat in a choir"" is attested from c.1400; that of ""urinal in a men's room"" is from 1967. Several meanings, including that of ""a stand for selling"" (mid-13c., implied in stallage), probably are from (or influenced by) Anglo-French and Old French estal ""station, position; stall of a stable; stall in a market; a standing still; a standing firm"" (12c., Modern French étal ""butcher's stall""). This, along with Italian stallo ""place,"" stalla ""stable"" is a borrowing from a Germanic source from the same root as the native English word. stall (n.2)  ""pretense or evasive story to avoid doing something,"" 1812, from earlier sense ""thief's assistant"" (1590s, also staller), from a variant of stale ""bird used as a decoy to lure other birds"" (mid-15c.), from Anglo-French estale ""decoy, pigeon used to lure a hawk"" (13c., compare stool pigeon), literally ""standstill,"" from Old French estal ""place, stand, stall,"" from Frankish *stal- ""position,"" ultimately from Germanic and cognate with Old English steall (see stall (n.1)). Compare Old English stælhran ""decoy reindeer,"" German stellvogel ""decoy bird."" Figurative sense of ""deception, means of allurement"" is first recorded 1520s. Also see stall (v.2).
