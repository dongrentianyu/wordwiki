The sense might reflect the ""breeches"" sense, on the notion of two limbs or of appliances used in pairs. The typographical bracket is first recorded 1750, so called for its resemblance to double supports in carpentry (a sense attested from 1610s). Senses affected by Latin brachium ""arm."" bracket (v.)  1797, of printed matter, ""to enclose in brackets,"" from bracket (n.). Also, ""to couple or connect with a brace"" (1827), also figurative, ""to couple one thing with another"" in writing (1807). Artillery rangefinding sense is from 1903, from the noun (1891) in the specialized sense ""distance between the ranges of two shells, one under and one over the object."" Related: Bracketed; bracketing. In home-building and joinery, bracketed is attested by 1801."
