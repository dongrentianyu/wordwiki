""raw recruit,"" 1892 in that spelling, popularized by Kipling's ""Barrack-Room Ballads,"" of uncertain origin, perhaps from recruit, influenced by rook (n.1) in its secondary sense, suggesting ""easy to cheat."" Barrère [""A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon & Cant,"" 1890] has ""Rookey (army), a recruit; from the black coat some of them wear,"" so perhaps directly from rook (n.1). Came into general use in American English during the Spanish-American War. The rapid growth of a word from a single seed transplanted in a congenial soil is one of the curiosities of literature. Take a single instance. A few weeks ago there was not one American soldier in a thousand who knew there was such a word as ""rookey."" To-day there are few soldiers and ex-soldiers who have not substituted it for ""raw recruit."" [""The Midland Monthly,"" December 1898]"
