title:unbend

"v.弄直；放松 【英】 v. 弄直( become straight);放松( behave in a less formal and severe manner) 【记】 un（不）+bend（弯曲 ） 无 无 unbend (v.)  mid-13c., ""relax a bow by unstringing it,"" from un- (2) ""reverse, opposite of"" + bend (v.). Intransitive sense from 1746. Figurative meaning ""to become genial, relax"" (1748) has a sense opposite to that of unbending ""inflexible, obstinate"" (1680s), which does not derive from the bow-stringing image."
