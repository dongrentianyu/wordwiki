"n.兽皮 【英】 n. 兽皮(an animal skin or pelt) 【考】 miller : grain / tanner : hide(磨房工人加工谷物/ 鞣革工人加工皮革) n. 兽皮(动物厚密、粗糙的生皮或毛皮); v 隐藏 = secrete; 隐瞒 = conceal 【类】miller: grain = tanner: hide 磨房工人加工谷物 = 鞣革工人加工皮革 【记】人的皮是要藏起来的，不能露着的,否则赤身裸体成何体统 hide (v.1)  Old English hydan ""to hide, conceal; preserve; hide oneself; bury a corpse,"" from West Germanic *hudjan (cognates: Middle Dutch, Middle Low German huden), from PIE *keudh- (source also of Greek keuthein ""to hide, conceal""), from root *(s)keu- ""to cover, conceal"" (see hide (n.1)). Hide and seek (by 1670s), children's game, replaced earlier all hid (1580s). hide (n.1)  ""skin of a large animal,"" Old English hyd ""hide, skin,"" from Proto-Germanic *hudiz (cognates: Old Norse huð, Old Frisian hed, Middle Dutch huut, Dutch huid, Old High German hut, German Haut ""skin""), related to Old English verb hydan ""to hide,"" the common notion being of ""covering."" All of this is from PIE root *(s)keu- ""to cover, conceal"" (cognates: Sanskrit kostha ""enclosing wall,"" skunati ""covers;"" Armenian ciw ""roof;"" Latin cutis ""skin,"" scutum ""shield,"" ob-scurus ""dark;"" Greek kytos ""a hollow, vessel,"" keutho ""to cover, to hide,"" skynia ""eyebrows;"" Russian kishka ""gut,"" literally ""sheath;"" Lithuanian kiautas ""husk,"" kutis ""stall;"" Old Norse sky ""cloud;"" Old English sceo ""cloud;"" Middle High German hode ""scrotum;"" Old High German scura, German Scheuer ""barn;"" Welsh cuddio ""to hide""). The alliterative pairing of hide and hair (often negative, hide nor hair) was in Middle English (early 15c.), but earlier and more common was hide ne hewe, literally ""skin and complexion ('hue')"" (c.1200). hide (n.2)  ""measure of land"" (obsolete), Old English hid ""hide of land,"" earlier higid, from hiw- ""family"" (related to hiwan ""household,"" hiwo ""a husband, master of a household""), from Proto-Germanic *hiwido-, from PIE *keiwo- (source also of Latin civis ""citizen""), from root *kei- ""to lie; bed, couch; beloved, dear"" (see cemetery, and compare city). The notion was of ""amount of land needed to feed one free family and dependents,"" usually 100 or 120 acres, but the amount could be as little as 60, depending on the quality of the land. Often also defined as ""as much land as could be tilled by one plow in a year."" Translated in Latin as familia."
