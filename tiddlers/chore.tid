"n. 家务琐事；讨厌的工作 【英】 n.家务琐事(daily domestic task);讨厌的工作(unpleasa nt task) n. (例行的、不重要的)家务琐事; 令人讨厌的繁重的工作 【例】It'apos;s such a chore to do the shopping! 买东西真烦人! 【记】读: 臭: 作家务事肯定全身发臭! 【记】音：吵，总是吵嘴，因为讨厌的家务事 chore (n.)  1751, American English, variant of char, from Middle English cherre ""odd job,"" from Old English cerr, cierr ""turn, change, time, occasion, affair business."" Chore, a corruption of char, is an English word, still used in many parts of England, as a char-man, a char-woman; but in America, it is perhaps confined to New England. It signifies small domestic jobs of work, and its place cannot be supplied by any other single word in the language. [Noah Webster, ""Dissertations on the English Language,"" 1789]"
