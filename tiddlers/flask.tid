"n.烧瓶，细颈瓶 【记】 和flash(闪光)一起记 (something flashes in a flask 东西在烧瓶中闪光) n. 细颈瓶; 烧瓶 【记】flask里是用来烧flash(v /n 闪光)的东西的! Fl = fly, ask: 联想神话故事中有一个神仙可以从海里漂浮的瓶子中飞出来, 然后你在提出三个要求, 他可以满足你. 【记】flash闪闪发光，什么东东，原来是里面正在燃烧的烧瓶 flask (n.)  mid-14c., from Medieval Latin flasco ""container, bottle,"" from Late Latin flasconem ""bottle,"" perhaps from a Germanic source (compare Old English flasce, Old High German flaska, Middle Dutch flasce, German Flasche ""bottle""), and if so, perhaps originally meaning ""a bottle plaited round, case bottle"" (compare Old High German flechtan ""to weave,"" Old English fleohtan ""to braid, plait""), from Proto-Germanic base *fleh- (see flax). Another theory traces it to a metathesis of Latin vasculum. ""The assumption that the word is of Teut. origin is chronologically legitimate, and presents no difficulty exc. the absence of any satisfactory etymology"" [OED]."
