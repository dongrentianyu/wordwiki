"v.托付；承诺；犯罪 【英】 v. 托付(consign)承诺(to bind or obligate)犯罪(perpetrate) 【记】 com+mit(送)+ment→ 一起送给→把…交讬 给(commit a child to the care of a nursary )，对方接受后便要承 诺责任 无 无 commit (v.)  late 14c., ""to give in charge, entrust,"" from Latin committere ""to unite, connect, combine; to bring together,"" from com- ""together"" (see com-) + mittere ""to put, send"" (see mission). Evolution into modern range of meanings is not entirely clear. Sense of ""perpetrating"" was ancient in Latin; in English from mid-15c. The intransitive use (in place of commit oneself) first recorded 1982, probably influenced by existentialism use (1948) of commitment to translate Sartre's engagement ""emotional and moral engagement."""
