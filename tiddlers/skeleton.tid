Skelton was an early variant form. The noun use of Greek skeletos passed into Late Latin (sceletus), hence French squelette and rare English skelet (1560s), Spanish esqueleto, Italian scheletro. The meaning ""bare outline"" is first recorded c.1600; hence skeleton crew (1778), skeleton key, etc. Phrase skeleton in the closet ""source of secret shame to a person or family"" is from 1812."
