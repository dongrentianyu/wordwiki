The word seems to have been Scottish. Reading over this note to an American gentleman, he seemed to take alarm, lest the word ramshackle should be palmed on his country. I take it home willingly, as a Scotticism, and one well applied, as may be afterwards shown. [Robert Gourlay, ""General Introduction to a Statistical Account of Upper Canada,"" London, 1822] Jamieson's ""Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language"" (1825) has it as a noun meaning ""thoughtless, ignorant fellow."""
