Old English weosule, wesle ""weasel,"" from Proto-Germanic *wisulon (cognates: Old Norse visla, Middle Dutch wesel, Dutch wezel, Old High German wisula, German Wiesel), probably related to Proto-Germanic *wisand- ""bison"" (see bison), with a base sense of ""stinking animal,"" because both animals have a foul, musky smell (compare Latin vissio ""stench""). A John Wesilheued (""John Weaselhead"") turns up on the Lincolnshire Assize Rolls for 1384, but the name seems not to have endured, for some reason. Related: Weaselly. weasel (v.)  ""to deprive (a word or phrase) of its meaning,"" 1900, from weasel (n.); so used because the weasel sucks out the contents of eggs, leaving the shell intact. Both this and weasel-word are first attested in ""The Stained-Glass Political Platform,"" a short story by Stewart Chaplin, first printed in ""Century Magazine,"" June 1900: ""Why, weasel words are words that suck all the life out of the words next to them, just as a weasel sucks an egg and leaves the shell. If you heft the egg afterward it's as light as a feather, and not very filling when you're hungry; but a basketful of them would make quite a show, and would bamboozle the unwary."" They were picked up at once in American political slang. The sense of ""extricate oneself (from a difficult place) like a weasel"" is first recorded 1925; that of ""to evade and equivocate"" is from 1956. Related: Weasled; weasling."
