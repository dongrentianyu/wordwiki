"v. 把…装饰得艳丽而俗气 【英】 v.把...装饰得华丽而 俗气(dress with vulgar finery) 【记】 联想: bed(床)+izen→把床 弄得华丽 v. 把...装饰得过分华丽而俗气; 穿着俗丽 【记】bed床. 参见: bedeck 【记】bed 床 + zen 音：枕，床上的枕头，床枕头都是绣花的，装饰华丽 bedizen (v.)  1660s, from be- + dizen ""to dress"" (1610s), especially, from late 18c., ""to dress finely, adorn,"" originally ""to dress (a distaff) for spinning"" (1520s), and evidently the verbal form of the first element in distaff. It is remarkable that neither the vb., nor the sb. as a separate word, has been found in OE. or ME., and that on the other hand no vb. corresponding to dizen is known in L.G. or Du. [OED]"
