Modern sense began with use as appellation of various foreign officials and magistrates, ""a representative chosen by a community of merchants living in a foreign country; an agent appointed by a government or ruler to represent the interests of its subjects and traders in a foreign place"" (c.1600), an extended sense that developed 13c. in the Spanish form of the word."
