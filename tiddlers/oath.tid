title:oath

"n.誓言；咒骂 无 无 无 oath (n.)  Old English að ""oath, judicial swearing, solemn appeal to deity in witness of truth or a promise,"" from Proto-Germanic *aithaz (cognates: Old Norse eiðr, Swedish ed, Old Saxon, Old Frisian eth, Middle Dutch eet, Dutch eed, German eid, Gothic aiþs ""oath""), from PIE *oi-to- ""an oath"" (cognates: Old Irish oeth ""oath""). Common to Celtic and Germanic, possibly a loan-word from one to the other, but the history is obscure. In reference to careless invocations of divinity, from late 12c."
