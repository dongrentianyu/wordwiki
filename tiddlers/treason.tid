"n.叛国罪 【英】 叛国罪 (the offense of attempting by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which the offender owes allegiance) 【例】 They were convicted of treason.(他们被判叛 国罪) 无 【记】trea + son 人，traitor 叛徒 也是trai + tor人；treasure + son 人，为了财富而背叛 treason (n.)  c.1200, ""betraying; betrayal of trust; breech of faith,"" from Anglo-French treson, from Old French traison ""treason, treachery"" (11c.; Modern French trahison), from Latin traditionem (nominative traditio) ""a handing over, delivery, surrender"" (see tradition). Old French form influenced by the verb trair ""betray."" In old English law, high treason is violation by a subject of his allegiance to his sovereign or to the state; distinguished from petit treason, treason against a subject, such as murder of a master by his servant. Constructive treason was a judicial fiction whereby actions carried out without treasonable intent, but found to have the effect of treason, were punished as though they were treason itself. The protection against this accounts for the careful wording of the definition of treason in the U.S. Constitution."
