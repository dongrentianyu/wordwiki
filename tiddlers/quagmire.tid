Early spellings include quamyre (1550s), quabmire (1590s), quadmire (c.1600). Extended sense of ""difficult situation, inescapable bad position"" is recorded by 1766; but this seems to have been not in common use in much of 19c. (absent in ""Century Dictionary,"" 1902), but revived in a narrower sense in reference to military invasions in American English, 1965, with reference to Vietnam (popularized in the book title ""The Making of a Quagmire"" by David Halberstam)."
