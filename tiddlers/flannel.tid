"n. 法兰绒(一种布) 【考】 flannel : cloth / linen : fabric(法兰绒是一种布料/ 亚麻是一种织物) n. 法兰绒(用羊毛、棉纱或化纤的混合物织成的一种柔软的布) 【记】音译词 【类】flannel: cloth = linen: fabric『limerick: poem』不是布料范畴法兰绒是一种布料 = 亚麻是一种织物『五行诗: 诗歌』 【记】译音 flannel (n.)  c.1500, probably from Welsh gwlanen ""woolen cloth,"" from gwlan ""wool,"" from Celtic *wlana, from PIE *wele- (1) ""wool"" (see wool). The Welsh origin is not a universally accepted etymology, due to the sound changes involved; some (Barnhart, Gamillscheg) suggest the English word is from an Anglo-French diminutive of Old French flaine ""a kind of coarse wool."" ""As flannel was already in the 16th c. a well-known production of Wales, a Welsh origin for the word seems antecedently likely"" [OED]. Modern French flanelle is a 17c. borrowing from English."
