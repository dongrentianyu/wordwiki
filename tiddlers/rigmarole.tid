title:rigmarole

"n. 冗长的废话 无 无 无 rigmarole (n.)  1736, ""a long, rambling discourse,"" apparently from an altered, Kentish colloquial survival of ragman roll ""long list or catalogue"" (1520s), in Middle English a long roll of verses descriptive of personal characters, used in a medieval game of chance called Rageman, perhaps from Anglo-French Ragemon le bon ""Ragemon the good,"" which was the heading on one set of the verses, referring to a character by that name. Sense transferred to ""foolish activity or commotion"" by 1939."
