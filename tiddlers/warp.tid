""to bend, twist, distort,"" Old English weorpan ""to throw, throw away, hit with a missile,"" from Proto-Germanic *werpan ""to fling by turning the arm"" (cognates: Old Saxon werpan, Old Norse verpa ""to throw,"" Swedish värpa ""to lay eggs,"" Old Frisian werpa, Middle Low German and Dutch werpen, German werfen, Gothic wairpan ""to throw""), from PIE *werp- ""to turn, wind, bend"" (cognates: Latin verber ""whip, rod;"" Greek rhabdos ""rod,"" rhombos ""magic wheel""), from root *wer- (3) ""to turn, bend"" (see versus). Connection between ""turning"" and ""throwing"" is perhaps in the notion of rotating the arm in the act of throwing; compare Old Church Slavonic vrešti ""to throw,"" from the same PIE root. The meaning ""twist out of shape"" is first recorded c.1400; intransitive sense is from mid-15c. Related: Warped; warping. warp (n.)  ""threads running lengthwise in a fabric,"" Old English wearp, from Proto-Germanic *warpo- (cognates: Middle Low German warp, Old High German warf ""warp,"" Old Norse varp ""cast of a net""), from PIE *werp- ""to turn, bend"" (see warp (v.)). The warp of fabric is that across which the woof is ""thrown."" Applied in 20c. astrophysics to the ""fabric"" of space-time, popularized in noun phrase warp speed by 1960s TV series ""Star Trek."""
