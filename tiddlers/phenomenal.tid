title:phenomenal

"a.显著的，非凡的 无 adj. 现象的; 非凡的 = outstanding 【参】phenomenology(n 现象学) 【反】ordinary(adj 平常的); commonplace(n 平凡的事; adj 平凡的) 【记】phenomenon 现象,一种现象 phenomenal (adj.)  1803, ""of the nature of a phenomenon,"" a hybrid from phenomenon + -al (1). Meaning ""remarkable, exceptional"" is from 1850. [Phenomenal] is a metaphysical term with a use of its own. To divert it from this proper use to a job for which it is not needed, by making it do duty for remarkable, extraordinary, or prodigious, is a sin against the English language.
