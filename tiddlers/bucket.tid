The rain was coming down in buckets 天下着倾盆大雨. 【记】类basket的东西；buck bucket (n.)  mid-13c., from Anglo-French buquet ""bucket, pail,"" from Old French buquet ""bucket,"" which is from a Germanic source, or a diminutive of cognate Old English buc ""pitcher, bulging vessel,"" originally ""belly"" (buckets were formerly of leather as well as wood), both from West Germanic *buh- (cognates: Dutch buik, Old High German buh, German Bauch ""belly""), possibly from a variant of PIE root *beu-, *bheu- ""to grow, swell"" (see bull (n.2)). Kick the bucket ""to die"" (1785) perhaps is from unrelated Old French buquet ""balance,"" a beam from which slaughtered animals were hung; perhaps reinforced by the notion of suicide by hanging after standing on an upturned bucket (but Farmer calls attention to bucket ""a Norfolk term for a pulley"")."
