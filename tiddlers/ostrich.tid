"n.鸵鸟；不接受现实的人 【记】 try to play ostrich and pretend not to see 【例】 try to play ostrich and pretend not to see 无 【记】Australia 澳州 + chick 鸡 (tri->chi, ch->ck)→澳州产的鸡→驼鸟 ostrich (n.)  early 13c., from Old French ostruce ""ostrich"" (Modern French autruche) and Medieval Latin ostrica, ostrigius, all from Vulgar Latin avis struthio, from Latin avis ""bird"" (see aviary) + Late Latin struthio ""ostrich,"" from Greek strouthion ""ostrich,"" from strouthos megale ""big sparrow,"" perhaps from PIE *trozdo- ""thrush"" (see thrush (n.1)). The Greeks also knew the bird as strouthokamelos ""camel-sparrow,"" for its long neck. Among its proverbial peculiarities are indiscriminate voracity (especially a habit of swallowing iron and stone to aid digestion), want of regard for its eggs, and a tendency to hide its head in the sand when pursued.Like the Austridge, who hiding her little head, supposeth her great body obscured. [1623, recorded in OED]Ostriches do put their heads in the sand, but ostrich farmers say they do this in search of something to eat."
