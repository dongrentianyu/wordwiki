"n.(象)长牙 【英】 n.(象)长牙(an elongated greatly enlarged tooth) 无 【记】近于tooth 牙齿 + 音：啃，用长牙啃 【相关】tush长牙 tusk (n.)  Old English tusc, also transposed as tux, ""long, pointed tooth protruding from the mouth of an animal,"" cognate with Old Frisian tusk, probably from Proto-Germanic *tunthsk- (cognates: Gothic tunþus ""tooth""), from an extended form of PIE *dent-, the root of tooth. But ""there are no certain cognates outside of the Anglo-Frisian area"" [OED]."
