"n.抵押贷款；抵押证书；v.用…作抵押 【英】 抵押贷款(the pledging of property to a creditor as security for the payment of a debt);抵押证书(the deed by which this pledge is made);抵押(to pledge[a property] by a mortgage) 【记】 mort(死亡)+gage(抵 押品) 【例】 He will have to mortgage his land for a loan. n. /v. 抵押 【记】mortgage源于mort死和gage抵押. 这与抵押人是否能偿还债务的不确定性有关. 如果借款人未偿还债物, 那么抵押给贷款人作为债务安全保证的地产将从他那儿被永远剥夺, 因此对他来说在一定条件下失去了全部意义. 如果他确实还了债务, 那么抵押对于贷款人也失去了全部意义. 【记】mort 死 + gage 抵押，用生命来抵押；mortal + engage 用生命来保证 【相关】engage 保证，订婚，预订 mortgage (n.)  late 14c., morgage, ""conveyance of property as security for a loan or agreement,"" from Old French morgage (13c.), mort gaige, literally ""dead pledge"" (replaced in modern Frech by hypothèque), from mort ""dead"" (see mortal (adj.)) + gage ""pledge"" (see wage (n.)). So called because the deal dies either when the debt is paid or when payment fails. Old French mort is from Vulgar Latin *mortus ""dead,"" from Latin mortuus, past participle of mori ""to die"" (see mortal (adj.)). The -t- restored in English based on Latin. mortgage (v.)  late 15c., from mortgage (n.). Related: Mortgaged; mortgaging."
