Perhaps from an old name for Egypt (Khemia, literally ""land of black earth,"" found in Plutarch), or from Greek khymatos ""that which is poured out,"" from khein ""to pour,"" related to khymos ""juice, sap"" [Klein, citing W. Muss-Arnolt, calls this folk etymology]. The word seems to have elements of both origins.Mahn ... concludes, after an elaborate investigation, that Gr. khymeia was probably the original, being first applied to pharmaceutical chemistry, which was chiefly concerned with juices or infusions of plants; that the pursuits of the Alexandrian alchemists were a subsequent development of chemical study, and that the notoriety of these may have caused the name of the art to be popularly associated with the ancient name of Egypt. [OED]The al- is the Arabic definite article, ""the."" The art and the name were adopted by the Arabs from Alexandrians and thence returned to Europe via Spain. Alchemy was the ""chemistry"" of the Middle Ages and early modern times; since c.1600 the word has been applied distinctively to the pursuit of the transmutation of baser metals into gold, which, along with the search for the universal solvent and the panacea, were the chief occupations of early chemistry."
