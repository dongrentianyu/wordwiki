"n.百科全书 无 无 无 encyclopedia (n.)  1530s, ""course of instruction,"" from Modern Latin encyclopaedia (c.1500), thought to be a false reading by Latin authors of Greek enkyklios paideia taken as ""general education,"" but literally ""training in a circle,"" i.e. the ""circle"" of arts and sciences, the essentials of a liberal education; from enkyklios ""circular,"" also ""general"" (from en ""in"" + kyklos ""circle"") + paideia ""education, child-rearing,"" from pais (genitive paidos) ""child"" (see pedo-). Modern sense of ""reference work arranged alphabetically"" is from 1640s, often applied specifically to the French ""Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des Sciences, des Arts, et des Métiers"" (1751-65)."
