"n.(植物)大黄；v./n.喧闹争吵 【英】 n./v.喧闹(a heated dispute or controversy) 【例】 a Roman mob rhubarbing at the Palace door(冲着宫殿大门乱 嚷嚷的一群罗马暴民) n. 大黄(有绿色或微红色带酸味的长叶柄, 加糖或烹制后可食用) 【记】源于它生长在我们称之为伏尔加河的Rha河附近读: 辱爸爸, 天天给爸爸吃大黄(在中国是一种泻药)是一种侮辱. 【记】里面有herb草药；hubbub 喧闹；r读l 音：拉巴巴，吃了大黄就腹泻拉巴巴，引起腹内喧闹 rhubarb (n.)  late 14c., from Old French rubarbe, from Medieval Latin rheubarbarum, from Greek rha barbaron ""foreign rhubarb,"" from rha ""rhubarb,"" perhaps ultimately from a source akin to Persian rewend ""rhubarb"" (associated in Greek with Rha, ancient Scythian name of the River Volga) + barbaron, neuter of barbaros ""foreign"" (see barbarian). Grown in China and Tibet, it was imported into ancient Europe by way of Russia. Spelling altered in Medieval Latin by association with rheum. European native species so called from 1640s. Baseball slang meaning ""loud squabble on the field"" is from 1938, of unknown origin, said to have been first used by broadcaster Garry Schumacher. Perhaps connected with use of rhubarb as a word repeated by stage actors to give the impression of hubbub or conversation (attested from 1934)."
