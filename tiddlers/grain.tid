""seed, grain, particle, berry, scarlet dye"" (see kermes for last sense), from Latin granum ""seed, a grain, small kernel"" (see corn (n.1)). As a collective singular meaning ""seed of wheat and allied grasses used as food,"" it is attested from early 14c. Extended from c.1300 to other objects (such as salt, sand). As a unit of weight, from 1540s. Used of wood (1560s), from the arrangement of fibers, which resemble seeds. Hence, against the grain (1650), a metaphor from carpentry: cutting across the fibers of the wood is more difficult than cutting along them."
