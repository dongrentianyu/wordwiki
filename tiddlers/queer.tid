To queer the pitch (1846) is in reference to the patter of an itinerant tradesman or showman (see pitch (n.1)). These wanderers, and those who are still seen occasionally in the back streets of the metropolis, are said to 'go a-pitching ;' the spot they select for their performance is their 'pitch,' and any interruption of their feats, such as an accident, or the interference of a policeman, is said to 'queer the pitch,'--in other words, to spoil it. [Thomas Frost, ""Circus Life and Circus Celebrities,"" London, 1875]"
