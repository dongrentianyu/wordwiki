"n.公理；定理 【英】 n.公理(maxim)；定理 (an established principle) n. (不言而喻的, 普遍被认定的或数学上的)公理, 格言 【例】Archimedean axiom 阿基米德公理 【记】和maxim(n 格言, 座右铭)一起记 【记】几个字母换一下就是maxim；坏人说axe就是axiom，斧子是公理 axiom (n.)  late 15c., from Middle French axiome, from Latin axioma, from Greek axioma ""authority,"" literally ""that which is thought worthy or fit,"" from axioun ""to think worthy,"" from axios ""worthy, worth, of like value, weighing as much,"" from PIE adjective *ag-ty-o- ""weighty,"" from root *ag- ""to drive, draw, move"" (see act (n.)). Axioms in philosophy are not axioms until they are proved upon our pulses. [Keats, letter, May 3, 1818]"
