"n.补丁；一小片(土地) 【英】 n. 补丁(a piece of material used to mend or cover a hole)；一小片(土地)(a small piece) 【例】 a patch of cloud in the blue sky / a patch of cabbages 无 【记】pitch 沥青，常见到用一小块沥青作补丁来修补公路上的坑；计算机要及时下载补丁程序，就是这个patch patch (v.)  mid-15c., from patch (n.1). Electronics sense of ""to connect temporarily"" is attested from 1923. Related: Patched; patching. patch (n.1)  ""piece of cloth used to mend another material,"" late 14c., of obscure origin, perhaps a variant of pece, pieche, from Old North French pieche (see piece (n.)), or from an unrecorded Old English word (but Old English had claðflyhte ""a patch""). Phrase not a patch on ""nowhere near as good as"" is from 1860. patch (n.2)  ""fool, clown,"" 1540s, perhaps from Italian pazzo ""fool,"" of unknown origin. Possibly from Old High German barzjan ""to rave"" [Klein].  But Buck says pazzo is originally euphemistic, and from Latin patiens ""suffering,"" in medical use, ""the patient."" Form perhaps influenced by folk etymology derivation from patch (n.1), on notion of a fool's patched garb."
