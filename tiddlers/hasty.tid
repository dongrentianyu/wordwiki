"a.急急忙忙的 【英】 adj. 急急忙忙的(said, made or done too quickly ) 【考】 反义词：characteriz ed by deliberation(深思熟 虑地对待); well considered(考虑过的) 【例】 a hasty departure, meal, farewell adj. 急忙的; 草率的(因做得太仓促而不准确, 不明智的) = impetuous 【反】characterized by deliberation(以深思熟虑为特征); well considered(很好地考虑过的); deliberate(adj 深思熟虑的) 【记】haste 匆忙 hasty (adj.)  mid-14c., ""speedy, quick,"" by 1500s replacing or nativizing earlier hastif (c.1300) ""eager, impetuous,"" from Old French hastif ""speedy, rapid; forward, advanced; rash, impetuous"" (12c., Modern French hâtif), from haste (see haste). Meaning ""requiring haste"" is late 14c. (the sense in hasty pudding, 1590s, so called because it was made quickly); that of ""rash"" is from early 15c. Related: Hastiness. Old French also had a form hasti (for loss of terminal -f, compare joli/jolif, etc.), which may have influenced the form of the English word. The termination was doubtless from the first identified with native -i, -y, from OE -ig; and it is noticeable that the other Teutonic langs. have formed corresponding adjs. of that type: Du. haastig, Ger., Da., Sw. hastig.
