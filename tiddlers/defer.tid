Etymologically identical with differ; the spelling and pronunciation differentiated from 15c., perhaps partly by association of this word with delay. defer (v.2)  ""yield,"" mid-15c., from Middle French déférer (14c.) ""to yield, comply,"" from Latin deferre ""carry away, transfer, grant,"" from de- ""down, away"" (see de-) + ferre ""carry"" (see infer). Main modern sense is from meaning ""refer (a matter) to someone,"" which also was in Latin."
