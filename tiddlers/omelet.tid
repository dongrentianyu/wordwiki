"n.煎蛋卷 【英】 n. 煎蛋卷 (eggs beaten together and cooked in hot fat) 无 【记】O 象个鸡蛋 + melt 熔化，鸡蛋放在炒锅里熔化，本来是个球，后来流出来 omelet (n.)  1610s, from French omelette (16c.), metathesis of alemette (14c.), from alemele ""omelet,"" literally ""blade (of a knife or sword),"" probably a misdivision of la lemelle (mistaken as l'alemelle), from Latin lamella ""thin, small plate,"" diminutive of lamina ""plate, layer"" (see laminate). The food so called from its flat shape. The proverb ""you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs"" (1859) translates French On ne saurait faire une omelette sans casser des oeufs. Middle English had hanonei ""fried onions mixed with scrambled eggs"" (mid-15c.)."
