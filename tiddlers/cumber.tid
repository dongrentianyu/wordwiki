"v. 拖累，妨碍 【英】 vt. 拖累，妨碍(to hinder by obstruction or interference; hamper) 无 【记】音：扛木板 扛着木板时很笨重；cumber是lie 沉重，躺下的字根 【相关】decumbent 躺下，encumber 阻碍，incumbency 职责义务，procumbent 俯卧的, 匍匐，recumbent 靠着的, 斜躺的，succumb屈服 cumber (v.)  c.1300, ""to overthrow, destroy; to be overwhelmed; to harass,"" apparently from French, but Old French combrer ""to seize hold of, lay hands on, grab, snatch, take by force, rape,"" has not quite the same sense. Perhaps a shortened formation from a verb akin to Middle English acombren ""obstructing progress,"" from Old French encombrer, from combre ""obstruction, barrier,"" from Vulgar Latin *comboros ""that which is carried together,"" perhaps from a Gaulish word. The likely roots are PIE *kom (see com-) + *bher- (1) ""to bear"" (see infer). Weakened sense of ""to hamper, to obstruct or weigh down"" is late 14c. Related: Cumbered; cumbering."
