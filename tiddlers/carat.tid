"n. (宝石重量单位)克拉；(金子)开 【同】 近形词：karate(空手 道)，caret(加字符号) n. (宝石重量单位 = 200毫克)克拉; 开(黄金纯度单位, 纯金为24开, 音译词) 【参】karate(n 空手道), caret(n 加字符号) 【记】译音:克拉 carat (n.)  also karat, mid-15c., from Middle French carat ""measure of the fineness of gold"" (14c.), from Italian carato or Medieval Latin carratus, both from Arabic qirat ""fruit of the carob tree,"" also ""weight of 4 grains,"" from Greek keration ""carob seed,"" also the name of a small weight of measure (one-third obol), literally ""little horn"" diminutive of keras ""horn"" (see kerato-). Carob beans were a standard for weighing small quantities. As a measure of diamond weight, from 1570s in English. The Greek measure was the equivalent of the Roman siliqua, which was one-twentyfourth of a golden solidus of Constantine; hence karat took on a sense of ""a proportion of one twentyfourth"" and became a measure of gold purity (1550s). Eighteen carat gold is eighteen parts gold, six parts alloy. It is unlikely that the classical carat ever was a measure of weight for gold."
