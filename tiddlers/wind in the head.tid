<link href="adcp.css" rel="stylesheet"><entry><xh5>wind in the head • windmills in the head</xh5><p> <i>wind in the head—</i>1. vain imagination or conceit: He has probably got <u>wind in the head</u> through living in that gorgeous Gothic pagoda. 2. unpredictability or flippancy in behavior: “<u>Wind in the head</u>,” the servants called it. But it was but the natural consequence of the state of mental and bodily idleness in which she was placed.</p><p> <div class="note">Note</div> The expression does not correlate in meaning with the compound <b>airhead</b>—(U.S. sl.) smb. who isn’t very smart; a stupid person: “Spell check” can’t save the truly illiterate ones. How can such <u>airheads</u> ever manage to graduate?</p><p><i>windmills in the head—</i>foolish projects or notions: These <u>windmills in the head</u> are what apparently drive state policies about “national security.”</p> </entry>
