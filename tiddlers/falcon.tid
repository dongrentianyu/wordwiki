Fall can: 落下后才能捕食－鹰回忆: 一去一条线(aquiline)adj 象鹰的; 弯曲的 【记】fall + on 落在上面，猎鹰从天上落在你身上；fall + con 音：抠按，鹰飞下用爪子抠住猎物并将之按在地上；fall + 音：啃，从天上落下来啃；音：飞看，飞瞰，能边飞远看的 【相关】形意近似的 talon 鹰爪 falcon (n.)  mid-13c., from Old French faucon (12c.), from Late Latin falconem (nominative falco) ""falcon,"" probably from Latin falx (genitive falcis) ""curved blade, pruning hook, sickle;"" the bird said to be so called for the shape of its talons, legs, or beak, but also possibly from the shape of its spread wings. The other theory is that falx is of Germanic origin and means ""gray bird,"" which is supported by the antiquity of the word in Germanic but opposed by those who point out that falconry by all evidences was imported from the East, and the Germans got it from the Romans, not the other way around."
