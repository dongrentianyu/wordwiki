"n. 厚木板；要点 【英】 n. 厚木板(a heavy thick board)；要点(a principal item) 【例】 a plank on foreign policy(对外政策的要 点) 无 【记】plane 平的 + 音：壳；blank 白板 plank (n.)  late 13c. (c.1200 as a surname), from Old North French planke, variant of Old French planche ""plank, slab, little wooden bridge"" (12c.), from Late Latin planca ""broad slab, board,"" probably from Latin plancus ""flat, flat-footed,"" from PIE *plak- (1) ""to be flat"" (see placenta). Technically, timber sawed to measure 2 to 6 inches thick, 9 inches or more wide, and 8 feet or more long. Political sense of ""item of a party platform"" is U.S. coinage from 1848. To walk the plank, supposedly a pirate punishment, is first attested 1789 and most early references are to slave-traders disposing of excess human cargo in crossing the ocean."
