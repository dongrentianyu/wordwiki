"n. 涟漪 无 无 无 riffle (v.)  1754, ""to make choppy water,"" American English, perhaps a variant of ruffle ""make rough."" The word meaning ""shuffle"" (cards) is first recorded 1894, probably echoic; hence that of ""skim, leaf through quickly"" (of papers, etc.) is from 1922. Related: Riffled; riffling."
