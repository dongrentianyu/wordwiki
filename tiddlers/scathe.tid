Only cognate outside Germanic seems to be in Greek a-skethes ""unharmed, unscathed."" It survives mostly in its negative form, unscathed, and in figurative meaning ""sear with invective or satire"" (1852, usually as scathing) which developed from the sense of ""scar, scorch"" used by Milton in ""Paradise Lost"" i.613 (1667)."
