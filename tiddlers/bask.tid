title:bask

"v.晒太阳，取暖 【英】 v.晒太阳，取暖(to warm oneself pleasantly in the sunlight) 【记】 联想：把basket去掉e t, 就是bask→拎着篮子 晒太阳 【例】 I like to lie on the sand, basking in the sunshine. v. (为了享受温暖)晒太阳 【例】We basked ourselves on the beach 我们在海滩上晒太阳. 【记】来自于bath(身体泡在浴缸温水里)；bask 躺在basket里身体在温暖太阳光里； bask (v.)  late 14c., basken ""to wallow (in blood),"" with loss of middle syllable, from Old Norse baðask ""to bathe oneself,"" reflexive of baða ""bathe"" (see bathe). Modern meaning ""soak up a flood of warmth"" is apparently due to Shakespeare's use of the word in reference to sunshine in ""As You Like It"" (1600). Related: Basked; basking."
