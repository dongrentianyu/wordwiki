"n. 极蠢之人，低能儿 【英】 n. 极蠢之人，低能儿(a very foolish or stupid person) 【记】 moro(笨, 愚)+on→笨人，moron ic(痴愚的) 【例】 It is very impolite to call a mentally retarded person a moron. n. 蠢猪(智商在50-70之间的成年人) 【记】mor死, on上－死在就职典礼上－蠢猪 【记】音：毛人，这种人全身长毛，智力低下 moron (n.)  1910, medical Latin, from Greek (Attic) moron, neuter of moros ""foolish, dull, sluggish, stupid,"" probably cognate with Sanskrit murah ""idiotic."" Latin morus ""foolish"" is a loan-word from Greek. Adopted by the American Association for the Study of the Feeble-minded with a technical definition ""adult with a mental age between 8 and 12;"" used as an insult since 1922 and subsequently dropped from technical use. Linnæus had introduced morisis ""idiocy."" The feeble-minded may be divided into: (1) Those who are totally arrested before the age of three so that they show the attainment of a two-year-old child or less; these are the idiots. (2) Those so retarded that they become permanently arrested between the ages of three and seven; these are imbeciles. (3) Those so retarded that they become arrested between the ages of seven and twelve; these were formerly called feeble-minded, the same term that is applied to the whole group. We are now proposing to call them morons, this word being the Greek for ""fool."" The English word ""fool"" as formerly used describes exactly this grade of child--one who is deficient in judgment or sense. [Henry H. Goddard, in Journal of Proceedings and Addresses"" of the National Education Association of the United States, July 1910]"
