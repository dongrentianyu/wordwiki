""showy, tastelessly rich,"" 1580s, probably ultimately from Middle English gaudi ""large, ornamental bead in a rosary"" (early 14c.); but there is a parallel sense of gaudy as ""full of trickery"" (1520s), from Middle English gaud ""deception, trick,"" from gaudi ""a jest, trick,"" possibly from Anglo-French gaudir ""be merry, scoff,"" from Latin gaudere ""rejoice"" (see joy). Alternative etymology of the adjective is from Middle English gaudegrene ""yellowish-green"" (early 14c.), originally ""green dye"" obtained from a plant formerly known as weld, from a Germanic source (see weld (n.)), which became gaude in Old French. The English term supposedly shifted sense from ""weld-dye"" to ""bright."" As a noun, ""feast, festival"" 1650s, from gaudy day ""day of rejoicing"" (1560s)."
