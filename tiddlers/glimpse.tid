title:glimpse

"n./v. 瞥见，看一眼 【英】 n./v. 瞥见，看一眼(to look quickly; glance) 【记】 来自 glim(灯光)+pse→像 灯光一闪→瞥一眼 【例】 I glimpsed her among the crowd just before she disappeared from sight. n. /v. (简短地, 粗略地)一瞥 = glance 【记】glass + 音:一瞥视→眼镜(代表眼睛)一瞥；glim 一个微弱的光→眼光一瞥 glimpse (v.)  c.1400, ""to glisten, be dazzling,"" probably from Old English *glimsian ""shine faintly,"" from Proto-Germanic *glim- (see gleam). If so, the intrusive -p- would be there to ease pronunciation. Sense of ""catch a quick view"" first recorded mid-15c.  Related: Glimpsed. The noun is recorded from mid-16c.; earlier in verbal noun glimpsing (mid-14c.)."
