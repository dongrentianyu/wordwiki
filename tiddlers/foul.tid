Of weather, first recorded late 14c. In the sporting sense of ""irregular, unfair"" it is first attested 1797, though foul play is recorded from mid-15c. Baseball sense of ""out of play"" attested by 1860. Foulmart was a Middle English word for ""polecat"" (from Old English mearð ""marten""). foul (v.)  Old English fulian ""to become foul, rot,"" from ful (see foul (adj.)). Related: Fouled; fouling."
