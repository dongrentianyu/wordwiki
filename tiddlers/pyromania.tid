title:pyromania

"n. 纵火狂 【英】 n.纵火狂(an irresistible impulse to start fires) 【记】 pyro(火)＋mania(狂) n. 纵火狂(一种想要放火的不能控制的冲动) 【记】pyro火, mania狂 【参】pyre(n 火葬用的柴堆); pyrexia(n 发热) 【记】pyre + mania pyromania (n.)  1840, from pyro- ""fire"" + mania ""madness, frenzy."" Used in German in the 1830s. The propensity which leads an insane person to accomplish his purpose by burning, has been considered to merit particular notice, and to constitute a variety of monomania. Dr. Marc, of France, has published a memoir on the subject; he gives the name of pyromania to it, and considers that, like other insane propensities, it may be the result of instinct, or it may be the result of delusion--reasoning upon erroneous principles. [Alexander Morrison, M.D., ""The Physiognomy of Mental Diseases,"" London, 1840] An older word for it was incendiarism."
