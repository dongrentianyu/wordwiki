Meaning ""small, sharp nail with a flat head"" is attested from mid-15c. The meaning ""rope to hold the corner of a sail in place"" is first recorded late 15c. tack (v.1)  late 14c., ""to attach"" with a nail, etc., from tack (n.1). Meaning ""to attach as a supplement"" (with suggestion of hasty or arbitrary proceeding) is from 1680s. Related: Tacked; tacking. tack (n.2)  ""horse's harness, etc.,"" 1924, shortening of tackle (n.) in sense of ""equipment."" Tack in a non-equestrian sense as a shortening of tackle is recorded in dialect from 1777. tack (n.3)  ""food"" in general, but in dialect especially ""bad food,"" and especially among sailors ""food of a bread kind,"" 1833, perhaps a shortening and special use of tackle (n.) in the sense of ""gear."" But compare tack ""taste"" (c.1600), perhaps a variant of tact. tack (v.2)  ""turn a ship's course toward the wind at an angle,"" 1550s, from tack (n.1) in the ship-rigging sense (the ropes were used to move the vessel temporarily to one side or another of its general line of course, to take advantage of a side-wind); hence tack (n.) ""course of conduct or mode of action suited to some purpose"" (1670s), from figurative use of the verb (1630s). Related: Tacked; tacking."
