type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

<link href="adcp.css" rel="stylesheet"><entry><xh5>this is where I came in • where do I come in</xh5><p> <i>this is where I came in—</i>1. this is where I had to do my part: The facilities they have must be maintained and improved, so <u>this is where I came in</u> to help out. 2. my knowledge dates from this point: “Anything else you want to ask me?” “No. <u>This is where I came in</u>. Tomorrow we’ll go call on a few people who may have a few answers.”</p><p><i>where do I come in—</i>in what position am I under the circumstances; what part do I have to play: You ask me to work in your firm; but <u>where do I come in</u> and what are my duties?</p> </entry>
