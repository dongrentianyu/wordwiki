title:toll

"n.过路(桥)费；伤亡人数，损失；v.(缓慢而有规律地)敲 无 无 无 toll (n.)  ""tax, fee,"" Old English toll ""impost, tribute, passage-money, rent,"" variant of toln, cognate with Old Norse tollr, Old Frisian tolen, Old High German zol, German Zoll, probably representing an early Germanic borrowing from Late Latin tolonium ""custom house,"" from Latin telonium ""tollhouse,"" from Greek teloneion ""tollhouse,"" from telones ""tax-collector,"" from telos ""tax"" (see tele-; for sense, compare finance). On the other theory it is native Germanic and related to tell (v.) on the notion of ""that which is counted."" Originally in a general sense of ""payment exacted by an authority;"" meaning ""charge for right of passage along a road"" is from late 15c. toll (v.)  ""to sound with slow single strokes"" (intransitive), mid-15c., probably a special use of tollen ""to draw, lure,"" early 13c. variant of Old English -tyllan in betyllan ""to lure, decoy,"" and fortyllan ""draw away, seduce,"" of obscure origin. The notion is perhaps of ""luring"" people to church with the sound of the bells, or of ""drawing"" on the bell rope. Transitive sense from late 15c. Related: Tolled; tolling. The noun meaning ""a stroke of a bell"" is from mid-15c."
