"n.认识，察识，知识 【英】 n. 知觉,认识(knowledge , awareness) 【例】 These matters fall within the cognizance of this court. 无 无 cognizance (n.)  mid-14c., from Anglo-French conysance ""recognition,"" later, ""knowledge,"" from Old French conoissance ""acquaintance, recognition; knowledge, wisdom"" (Modern French connaissance), from past participle of conoistre ""to know,"" from Latin cognoscere ""to get to know, recognize,"" from com- ""together"" (see co-) + gnoscere ""to know"" (see notice (n.)). The -g- was restored in English spelling 15c. and has gradually affected the pronunciation, which was always ""con-."" The old pronunciation lingered longest in legal use."
