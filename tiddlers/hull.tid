Figurative use by 1831. hull (n.2)  ""body of a ship,"" 1550s, perhaps from hull (n.1) on fancied resemblance of ship keels to open peapods (compare Latin carina ""keel of a ship,"" originally ""shell of a nut;"" Greek phaselus ""light passenger ship, yacht,"" literally ""bean pod;"" French coque ""hull of a ship; shell of a walnut or egg""). Alternative etymology is from Middle English hoole ""ship's keel"" (mid-15c.), from the same source as hold (n.). hull (v.)  ""to remove the husk of,"" early 15c., from hull (n.1). Related: Hulled, which can mean both ""having a particular kind of hull"" and ""stripped of the hull."""
