title:magnanimity

"n.慷慨 无 无 无 magnanimity (n.)  mid-14c., ""loftiness of thought or purpose,"" from Old French magnanimité ""high-mindedness, generosity of spirit,"" from Latin magnanimitatem (nominative magnanimitas) ""greatness of soul, high-mindedness,"" from magnanimus ""having a great soul,"" from magnus ""great"" (see magnate) + animus ""mind, soul, spirit"" (see animus). Probably a loan-translation of Greek megalopsykhos ""high-souled, generous"" (Aristotle) or megathymus ""great-hearted."""
