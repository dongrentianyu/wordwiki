"n.(房屋等)大梁；光线 【英】 n.(房屋等)大梁；光 线(a shaft or stream of light) 【记】 分割记忆:be-am; 尤其注意GRE中常考的 “大梁”一义 n. 大梁(建筑中用作支撑的木材、金属或石头); 光柱; 臀围; 平衡木 【例】The beams fingered the sky 一道道灯光刺破天空. 【记】音：壁木，墙壁上的木头 beam (n.)  Old English beam originally ""living tree,"" but by late 10c. also ""rafter, post, ship's timber,"" from Proto-Germanic *baumaz (cognates: Old Norse baðmr, Old Frisian bam ""tree, gallows, beam,"" Middle Dutch boom, Old High German boum, German Baum ""tree,"" Gothic bagms), perhaps from PIE verb root *bheue- ""to grow"" (see be). The shift from *-au- to -ea- is regular in Old English. Meaning ""ray of light"" developed in Old English, probably because it was used by Bede to render Latin columna lucis, the Biblical ""pillar of fire."" Nautical sense of ""one of the horizontal transverse timbers holding a ship together"" is from early 13c., hence ""greatest breadth of a ship,"" and slang broad in the beam ""wide-hipped"" (of persons). To be on the beam (1941) was originally an aviator's term for ""to follow the course indicated by a radio beam."" beam (v.)  ""emit rays of light,"" early 15c., from beam (n.) in the ""ray of light"" sense. Sense of ""to smile radiantly"" is from 1804; that of ""to direct radio transmissions"" is from 1927. Related: Beamed; beaming."
