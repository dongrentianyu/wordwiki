"n.围栏；监禁；母天鹅 【英】 n. 围栏(a small enclosure of animals)；监禁(a small place of confinement) 【记】 pen作为'笔'一意大家 都知道 【例】 a pen of sheep(一栏羊) n. 雌天鹅 【记】源于pen鹅毛笔－雌天鹅 【类】sheep: ewe = swan: pen羊和母羊 = 天鹅和雌天鹅 【记】想象用巨型的pen 笔做成的围栏；penalty 刑罚就是关到围栏里监禁起来 【相关】pent 是其过去式，过去分词 pen (n.3)  slang, ""prison,"" 1884, shortening of penitentiary; earlier use (1845) probably is a figurative extension of pen (n.2). pen (n.1)  ""writing implement,"" late 13c., from Old French pene ""quill pen; feather"" (12c.) and directly from Latin penna ""a feather, plume,"" in plural ""a wing,"" in Late Latin, ""a pen for writing,"" from Old Latin petna, pesna, from PIE *pet-na-, suffixed form of root *pet- ""to rush; to fly"" (see petition (n.)). Latin penna and pinna ""a feather, plume;"" in plural ""a wing;"" also ""a pinnacle; battlement"" (see pin (n.)) are treated as identical in Watkins, etc., but regarded as separate (but confused) Latin words by Tucker and others, who derive pinna from PIE *spei- ""sharp point"" (see spike (n.1)) and see the ""feather/wing"" sense as secondary. In later French, this word means only ""long feather of a bird,"" while the equivalent of English plume is used for ""writing implement,"" the senses of the two words thus are reversed from the situation in English. Pen-and-ink (adj.) is attested from 1670s. Pen name is recorded from mid-19c. pen (v.2)  ""to enclose in a pen,"" c.1200, from Old English *pennian, from the source of pen (n.2). Related: Penned; penning.  pen (n.2)  ""enclosure for animals,"" Old English penn, penne, ""enclosure, pen, fold,"" of uncertain origin, perhaps related to Old English pinn ""pin, peg"" (see pin (n.)) on notion of a bolted gate or else ""structure made of pointed stakes."" pen (v.1)  late 15c., from pen (n.). Related: Penned; penning."
