""weary by too much, fill to loathing, surfeit,"" 1520s, from Middle English cloyen ""hinder movement, encumber"" (late 14c.), a shortening of accloyen (early 14c.), from Old French encloer ""to fasten with a nail, grip, grasp,"" figuratively ""to hinder, check, stop, curb,"" from Late Latin inclavare ""drive a nail into a horse's foot when shoeing,"" from Latin clavus ""a nail"" (see slot (n.2)). Accloye is a hurt that cometh of shooing, when a Smith driveth a nail in the quick, which make him to halt.
