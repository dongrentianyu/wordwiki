"a.理论的；纯精神上的，没有感官欲望的 无 无 无 Platonic (adj.)  1530s, ""of or pertaining to Greek philosopher Plato"" (429 B.C.E.-c.347 B.C.E.), from Latin Platonicus, from Greek Platonikos. The name is Greek Platon, properly ""broad-shouldered"" (from platys ""broad;"" see plaice (n.)). His original name was Aristocles. The meaning ""love free of sensual desire"" (1630s), which the word usually carries nowadays, is a Renaissance notion; it is based on Plato's writings in ""Symposium"" about the kind of interest Socrates took in young men, which originally had no reference to women. Related: Platonically."
