"n.蜡烛芯；灯芯 【英】 蜡烛芯(a piece of twisted thread in a candle, which burns as the wax melts)灯芯(a length of material in an oil lamp which draws up oil while burning) n. 蜡烛芯; 灯芯(用于蜡烛或油灯上, 使燃料升成火焰) 【记】wick的身体看上去很weak, 因为wick在大话西游里是朱茵演的. 【记】最weak的就是蜡烛芯了 wick (n.1)  ""bundle of fiber in a lamp or candle,"" 17c. spelling alteration of wueke, from Old English weoce ""wick of a lamp or candle,"" from West Germanic *weukon (cognates: Middle Dutch wieke, Dutch wiek, Old High German wiohha, German Wieche), of unknown origin, with no known cognates beyond Germanic. To dip one's wick ""engage in sexual intercourse"" (in reference to males) is recorded from 1958, perhaps from Hampton Wick, rhyming slang for ""prick,"" which would connect it rather to wick (n.2). wick (n.2)  ""dairy farm,"" now surviving, if at all, as a localism in East Anglia or Essex, it was once the common Old English wic ""dwelling place, lodging, house, mansion, abode,"" then coming to mean ""village, hamlet, town,"" and later ""dairy farm"" (as in Gatwick ""Goat-farm""). Common in this latter sense 13c.-14c. The word is from a general Germanic borrowing from Latin vicus ""group of dwellings, village; a block of houses, a street, a group of streets forming an administrative unit"" (see vicinity). Compare Old High German wih ""village,"" German Weichbild ""municipal area,"" Dutch wijk ""quarter, district,"" Old Frisian wik, Old Saxon wic ""village."""
