title:empiricism

"n.经验主义 【英】 n.经验主义(the practice of relying on observation and experiment) 【记】 来自empiric,原指单 凭经验而行医的医生, 分割记忆:empire(帝 国)+ical 无 无 empiricism (n.)  1650s, in the medical sense, from empiric + -ism. General sense is from 1796. Were I obliged to give a short name to the attitude in question, I should call it that of radical empiricism, in spite of the fact that such brief nicknames are nowhere more misleading than in philosophy. I say 'empiricism' because it is contented to regard its most assured conclusions concerning matters of fact as hypotheses liable to modification in the course of future experience; and I say 'radical,' because it treats the doctrine of monism itself as an hypothesis, and, unlike so much of the half way empiricism that is current under the name of positivism or agnosticism or scientific naturalism, it does not dogmatically affirm monism as something with which all experience has got to square. The difference between monism and pluralism is perhaps the most pregnant of all the differences in philosophy. [William James, preface to ""The Sentiment of Rationality"" in ""The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular Philosophy,"" 1897]"
