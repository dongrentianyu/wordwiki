"a.讳忌的；n.禁忌 【英】 adj.讳忌的(banned on grounds of morality);n.禁忌(a prohibition imposed by social custom) 【例】 a taboo subject(忌讳的话题) / violate the taboo(违犯禁忌) adj. (因社会习俗或感情上的反感而)忌讳的; n 禁忌 【记】读: 他不, 他不能这样, 因为忌讳 【记】音：大不,大不特不(的事)；音：太不；大逆不道的，绝对不能做的事 taboo (adj.)  also tabu, 1777 (in Cook's ""A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean""), ""consecrated, inviolable, forbidden, unclean or cursed,"" explained in some English sources as being from Tongan (Polynesian language of the island of Tonga) ta-bu ""sacred,"" from ta ""mark"" + bu ""especially."" But this may be folk etymology, as linguists in the Pacific have reconstructed an irreducable Proto-Polynesian *tapu, from Proto-Oceanic *tabu ""sacred, forbidden"" (compare Hawaiian kapu ""taboo, prohibition, sacred, holy, consecrated;"" Tahitian tapu ""restriction, sacred;"" Maori tapu ""be under ritual restriction, prohibited""). The noun and verb are English innovations first recorded in Cook's book."
