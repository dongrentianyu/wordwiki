"n.无花果；一点儿 【英】 n.无花果，一点儿(a trifling amount; little bit) n. 无花果(具有可食用的味甜、中空、呈梨状聚花果); 一点儿 【例】not care a fig 完全不放在心上 【记】fig = Figo(葡萄牙国家队右前卫)现效力于皇家马德里, 由于处于中场位置, 进球不多, 但是助攻极有威胁, 自己不开花, 帮助别人结果－无花果 【记】音：非果，无果，无花果 fig (n.)  early 13c., from Old French figue (12c.), from Old Provençal figa, from Vulgar Latin *fica, from Latin ficus ""fig tree, fig,"" which, with Greek sykon, Armenian t'uz is ""prob. fr. a common Mediterranean source"" [Buck], possibly a Semitic one (compare Phoenician pagh ""half-ripe fig""). A reborrowing of a word that had been taken directly from Latin as Old English fic. The insulting sense of the word in Shakespeare, etc. (A fig for ...) is 1570s, in part from fig as ""small, valueless thing,"" but also from Greek and Italian use of their versions of the word as slang for ""vulva,"" apparently because of how a ripe fig looks when split open [Rawson, Weekley]. Giving the fig (French faire la figue, Spanish dar la higa) was an indecent gesture of ancient provenance, made by putting the thumb between two fingers or into the mouth, with the intended effect of the modern gesture of ""flipping the bird"" (see bird (n.3)). Also compare sycophant. Use of fig leaf in figurative sense of ""flimsy disguise"" (1550s) is from Gen. iii:7."
