The word has made its way into most Western European languages. Originally ""low, flat-built seagoing vessel of one deck,"" once common in the Mediterranean; meaning ""cooking range on a ship"" dates from 1750. The printing sense is from 1650s, from French galée in the same sense, in reference to the shape of the oblong tray that holds the type. As a short form of galley-proof it is attested from 1890."
