According to Watkins, this is probably from PIE *sai-tlo-, with instrumental element *-tlo- + *sai- ""to bind, tie"" (see sinew), extended metaphorically to successive human generations as links in the chain of life. Another theory connects it with words for ""seed,"" from PIE root *se- ""to sow"" (see sow (v.), and compare Gothic mana-seþs ""mankind, world,"" literally ""seed of men""). Used in ecclesiastical writing like Greek aion ""of this world"" (see cosmos). It is source of French siècle. Ancient Roman ludi saeculares was a three-day, day-and-night celebration coming once in an ""age"" (120 years). In English, in reference to humanism and the exclusion of belief in God from matters of ethics and morality, from 1850s."
