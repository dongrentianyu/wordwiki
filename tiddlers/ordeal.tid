"n.严峻考验，痛苦经验 【英】 n. 严峻考验，痛苦经验( any difficult and severe trial) 【例】 Being lost in the wilderness for a week was an ordeal for the campers. n. (考验性格或忍耐力的)严峻考验, 痛苦经验 【记】or或许, deal交易: 或许可以交易, 也有不交易的危险－考验你的忍耐力. 【记】音：熬 + deal 做成一桩买卖要经过煎熬一般的严峻考验，原指古条顿族的神裁法，将嫌犯手浸于沸水中(煎熬)，受神主裁，手无损则无罪 ordeal (n.)  Old English ordel, ordal, ""trial by physical test,"" literally ""judgment, verdict,"" from Proto-Germanic noun *uz-dailjam (cognates: Old Saxon urdeli, Old Frisian urdel, Dutch oordeel, German urteil ""judgment""), literally ""that which is dealt out"" (by the gods), from *uzdailijan ""share out,"" related to Old English adælan ""to deal out"" (see deal (n.1)). Curiously absent in Middle English, and perhaps reborrowed 16c. from Medieval Latin or Middle French, which got it from Germanic. The notion is of the kind of arduous physical test (such as walking blindfolded and barefoot between red-hot plowshares) that was believed to determine a person's guilt or innocence by immediate judgment of the deity, an ancient Teutonic mode of trial. English retains a more exact sense of the word; its cognates in German, etc., have been generalized. Metaphoric extension to ""anything which tests character or endurance"" is attested from 1650s. The prefix or- survives in English only in this word, but was common in Old English and other Germanic languages (Gothic ur-, Old Norse or-, etc.) and originally was an adverb and preposition meaning ""out."""
