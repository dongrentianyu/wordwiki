title:pessimism

"n.悲观；悲观主义 无 n. 悲观主义(认为世界上的邪恶远远强于正义) 【记】optimism(n 乐观主义)opt选择－能选择－乐观pessimism读: 怕死mism－怕死主义－悲观主义 无 pessimism (n.)  1794 ""worst condition possible,"" borrowed (by Coleridge) from French pessimisme, formed (on model of French optimisme) from Latin pessimus ""worst,"" originally ""bottom-most,"" from PIE *ped-samo-, superlative of root *pes- ""foot"" (see foot (n.)). As a name given to the doctrines of Schopenhauer, Hartmann, etc., that this is the worst possible world, or that everything tends toward evil, it is first recorded 1835, from German pessimismus (Schopenhauer, 1819). The attempt to make a verb of it as pessimize (1862) did not succeed."
