"n.梯子横挡，梯级 【英】 n. 梯子横挡，梯级(cros s-bars that form the steps of a ladder) n. 梯子横挡; 椅子横档; 轮子横档 【记】run + 音：高，往高处跑需要踩在梯子的横档上一步步往上爬 rung (n.)  Old English hrung ""rod, bar,"" from Proto-Germanic *khrungo (cognates: Middle Low German runge, Old High German runga ""stake, stud, stave,"" German Runge ""stake, stud, stave,"" Middle Dutch ronghe, Dutch rong ""rung,"" Gothic hrugga ""staff""), of unknown origin with no connections outside Germanic. Sense in English narrowed to ""round or stave of a ladder"" (first attested late 13c.), but usage of cognate words remains more general in other Germanic languages. This [rungs] has generally been considered as a mere corruption of rounds; and people of education use only this latter word. [John Pickering, ""A Vocabulary or Collection of Words and Phrases which have been Supposed to be Peculiar to the United States of America,"" Boston, 1816]"
