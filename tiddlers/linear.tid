"a.线的；成直线的 【英】 adj. 线的(of lines)；成直线的(made of lines) 【记】 以上二词都来自line( 直线)，注意意义的不同 【例】 a lineal descendent(直系后代 ) / a linear design(线条图案) 无 【记】line linear (adj.)  1640s, from French linéaire, from Latin linearis ""belonging to a line,"" from linea ""string, line"" (see line (n.)). Essentially the same word as lineal; ""in Latin linearis the original suffix -alis was dissimilated to -aris, but in Late Latin this rule was no longer productive and the formation or re-formation in -alis remained unchanged."" [Barnhart]. Linear A and Linear B (1902-3) were names given to two related forms of linear Minoan writing discovered 1894-1901 in Crete by Sir Arthur Evans."
