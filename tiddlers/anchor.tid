"v.稳固；固定n.锚 无 无 无 anchor (n.)  Old English ancor, borrowed 9c. from Latin ancora ""anchor,"" from or cognate with Greek ankyra ""anchor, hook"" (see ankle). A very early borrowing and said to be the only Latin nautical term used in the Germanic languages. The -ch- form emerged late 16c., a pedantic imitation of a corrupt spelling of the Latin word. The figurative sense of ""that which gives stability or security"" is from late 14c. Meaning ""host or presenter of a TV or radio program"" is from 1965, short for anchorman. anchor (v.)  c.1200, from anchor (n.). Related: Anchored; anchoring."
