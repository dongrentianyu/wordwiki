"n. 诡计，花言巧语 【英】 n.诡计，花言巧语(a beguiling or playful trick) 【记】 参考: wily(狡诈的) 【例】 be tricked by the salesman's wiles into buying worthless goods 无 【记】will + ill 坏的意愿；vile 可耻的，坏的 【相关】同源于guile 诡计，gu=w wile (n.)  late Old English, wil ""stratagem, trick, sly artifice,"" perhaps from Old North French *wile (Old French guile), or directly from a Scandinavian source (compare Old Norse vel ""trick, craft, fraud,"" vela ""defraud""). Perhaps ultimately related to Old English wicca ""wizard"" (see Wicca). Lighter sense of ""amorous or playful trick"" is from c.1600. wile (v.)  late 14c., ""to deceive,"" from wile (n.). Related: Wiled; wiling. Sense of ""cause (time, etc.) to pass pleasantly, divert attention pleasantly"" is by 1796, from confusion with while (v.)."
