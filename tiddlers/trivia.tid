"n. 琐事，无价值之物 【英】 n.琐事，无价值之物( trivial facts or details) 【记】 tri(三)+via(路) →三条路→同时做三 件小事 无 【记】trivial 琐细的 【相关】trifle 琐事 trivia (n.)  ""trivialities, bits of information of little consequence,"" by 1932, from the title of a popular book by U.S.-born British aphorist Logan Pearsall Smith (1865-1946) first published in 1902 but popularized in 1918 (with ""More Trivia"" following in 1921 and a collected edition including both in 1933), containing short essays often tied to observation of small things and commonplace moments. Trivia is Latin, plural of trivium ""place where three roads meet;"" in transferred use, ""an open place, a public place."" The adjectival form of this, trivialis, meant ""public,"" hence ""common, commonplace"" (see trivial). The Romans also had trivius dea, the ""goddess of three ways,"" another name for Hecate, perhaps originally in her triple aspect (Selene/Diana/Proserpine), but also as the especial divinity of crossroads (Virgil has ""Nocturnisque hecate triviis ululata per urbes""). John Gay took this arbitrarily as the name of a goddess of streets and roads for his mock Georgic ""Trivia: Or, the Art of Walking the Streets of London"" (1716); Smith writes in his autobiography that he got the title from Gay. I KNOW too much; I have stuffed too many of the facts of History and Science into my intellectuals. My eyes have grown dim over books; believing in geological periods, cave dwellers, Chinese Dynasties, and the fixed stars has prematurely aged me. [""Trivia,"" 1918 edition] Then noted c.1965 as an informal fad game among college students wherein one asked questions about useless bits of information from popular culture (""What was Donald Duck's address?"") and others vied to answer first. Nobody really wins in this game which concentrates on sports, comics and television. Everyone knows that Amos's wife on the ""Amos 'n' Andy Show"" is Ruby, but who knows that she is from Marietta, Georgia? Trivia players do. They also know the fourth man in the infield of Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance, the Canadian who shot down Baron Von Richtofen, and can name ten Hardy Boy books. [""Princeton Alumni Weekly,"" Nov. 9, 1965] The board game Trivial Pursuit was released 1982 and was a craze in U.S. for several years thereafter."
