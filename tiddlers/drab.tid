"a.枯黄色的；无聊的 【英】 adj. 枯黄色的(of a dull yellowish brown)；无聊的(not bright or lively; monotonous) adj. 枯黄色的; 性格单调乏味的 = monotonous; n 妓女 【参】drabness (n 乏味; 无聊) = dullness = dreariness 【记】drag 拖拉，单调枯燥无聊 drab (n.)  1680s, ""color of natural, undyed cloth,"" from Middle French drap (see drape (n.)). Figurative sense is c.1880. Apparently not related to earlier word meaning ""a dirty, untidy woman"" (1510s), ""a prostitute"" (1520s), which seems to be connected with Irish drabog, Gaelic drabag ""dirty woman,"" and perhaps with Low German drabbe ""dirt."" Ultimately perhaps from PIE *dher- (1) ""to make muddy."" Meaning ""small, petty debt"" (the sense in dribs and drabs) is 1828, of uncertain connection to the other senses."
