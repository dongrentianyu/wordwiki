"v. 私刑处死 【英】 v. 私刑处死(to murder without lawful trial, as by hanging) 【记】 和lunch(午饭)一起记 (give lunch and then lynch吃饭然后处死) 【例】 The prisoner was taken from the sheriff and lynched by an angry mob. v. 私刑处死(不经过正当法律程序处死, 尤指被暴民绞死) 【记】源于: lunch－吃饭后处死读: 陵迟(处死) 【记】音：凌迟，凌迟处死，也就是常说的千刀万剐而死 lynch (v.)  1835, from earlier Lynch law (1811), likely named after William Lynch (1742-1820) of Pittsylvania, Virginia, who c.1780 led a vigilance committee to keep order there during the Revolution. Other sources trace the name to Charles Lynch (1736-1796) a Virginia magistrate who fined and imprisoned Tories in his district c.1782, but the connection to him is less likely. Originally any sort of summary justice, especially by flogging; narrowing of focus to ""extralegal execution by hanging"" is 20c. Lynch mob is attested from 1838. The surname is perhaps from Irish Loingseach ""sailor."" Compare earlier Lydford law, from a place in Dartmoor, England, ""where was held a Stannaries Court of summary jurisdiction"" [Weekley], hence: Lydford law: is to hang men first, and indite them afterwards. [Thomas Blount, ""Glossographia,"" 1656] Related: Lynched; lynching."
