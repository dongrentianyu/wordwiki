Old English mentel ""loose, sleeveless cloak,"" from Latin mantellum ""cloak"" (source of Italian mantello, Old High German mantal, German Mantel, Old Norse mötull), perhaps from a Celtic source. Reinforced and altered 12c. by cognate Old French mantel ""cloak, mantle; bedspread, cover"" (Modern French manteau), also from the Latin source. Figurative sense ""that which enshrouds"" is from c.1300. Allusive use for ""symbol of literary authority or artistic pre-eminence"" is from Elijah's mantle [2 Kings ii:13]. As a layer of the earth between the crust and core (though not originally distinguished from the core) it is attested from 1940. mantle (v.)  ""to wrap in a mantle,"" early 13c.; figurative use from mid-15c., from mantle (n.) or from Old French manteler. Related: Mantled; mantling."
