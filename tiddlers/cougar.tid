"n.美洲豹 【记】 cougar也被叫做puma, panther n. 美洲狮(一种黄褐色无斑纹的勇猛的野生猫科动物) = puma = panther 【记】读: 哭歌, 当你一边唱歌, 一边游览西半球山区美丽的风景时, 突然发现了一只cougar, 这时你就只能哭着唱歌了. 读: cool哥－美洲狮 【记】音：酷哥 【相关】puma 美洲狮，panther 豹 cougar (n.)  1774, from French couguar, Buffon's adaption (influenced by jaguar) of a word the Portuguese picked up in Brazil as çuçuarana, perhaps from Tupi susuarana, from suasu ""deer"" + rana ""false."" Another proposed source is Guarani guaçu ara. Evidently the cedillas dropped off the word before Buffon got it. Slang sense of ""older woman (35-plus) who seeks younger males as sex partners"" is attested by 2002; said in some sources to have originated in Canada, probably from some reference to predatory feline nature."
