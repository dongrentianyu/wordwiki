""act of throwing overboard"" to lighten a ship. This noun was an 18c. Marine Insurance writers' restoration of the earlier form and original sense of the 15c. word that had become jetsam, probably because jetsam had taken on a sense of ""things cast overboard"" and an unambiguous word was needed for ""act of throwing overboard."" Middle English jetteson (n.) ""act of throwing overboard"" is from Anglo-French getteson, from Old French getaison ""act of throwing (goods overboard),"" especially to lighten a ship in distress, from Late Latin iactionem (nominative iactatio) ""act of throwing,"" noun of action from past participle stem of iectare ""toss about"" (see jet (v.)).
