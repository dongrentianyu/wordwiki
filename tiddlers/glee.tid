Old English gliu, gliw ""entertainment, mirth, jest, play, sport,"" presumably from a Proto-Germanic *gleujam but absent in other Germanic languages except for the rare Old Norse gly ""joy;"" probably related to glad. A poetry word in Old English and Middle English, obsolete c.1500-c.1700, it somehow found its way back to currency late 18c. In Old English, an entertainer was a gleuman (female gleo-mægden). Glee club (1814) is from the secondary sense of ""unaccompanied part-song"" (1650s) as a form of musical entertainment."
