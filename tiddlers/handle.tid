To fly off the handle (1833) is a figurative reference to an ax head (to be off the handle ""be excited"" is recorded from 1825, American English). To get a handle on ""get control of"" is recorded by 1919.  handle (v.)  Old English handlian ""to touch or move with the hands,"" also ""deal with, discuss;"" see handle (n.). Akin to Old Norse höndla ""to seize, capture,"" Danish handle ""to trade, deal,"" German handeln ""to bargain, trade."" Related: Handled; handling. Meaning ""to act towards (someone) in a certain manner"" (usually with hostility or roughness) is from c.1200. The commercial sense was weaker in English than in some other Germanic languages, but it emerged in American English (1888) from the notion of something passing through one's hands, and see handler."
