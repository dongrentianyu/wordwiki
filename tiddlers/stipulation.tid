"n.规定，约定 【英】 n.规定，约定(a condition, requirement, or item in a legal instrument) 【考】 反义词：tacit requirement(心照不 宣的要求) n. 条款规定的东西 【反】tacit requirement(心照不宣的要求) 无 stipulation (n.)  1550s, ""a commitment or activity to do something"" (now obsolete), from Latin stipulationem (nominative stipulatio), noun of action from past participle stem of stipulari ""exact a promise, engage, bargain,"" of uncertain origin. Traditionally said to be from Latin stipula ""stalk, straw"" (see stipule) in reference to some obscure symbolic act; this is rejected by most authorities, who, however, have not come up with a better guess. Meaning ""act of specifying one of the terms of a contract or agreement"" is recorded from 1750. Meaning ""that which is stipulated or agreed upon"" is from 1802."
