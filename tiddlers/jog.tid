Meanings ""shake,"" ""stir up by hint or push,"" and ""walk or ride with a jolting pace"" are from 16c. The main modern sense in reference to running as training mostly dates from 1948; at first a regimen for athletes, it became a popular fad c.1967. Perhaps this sense is extended from its use in horsemanship. Jogging. The act of exercising, or working a horse to keep him in condition, or to prepare him for a race. There is no development in jogging, and it is wholly a preliminary exercise to bring the muscular organization to the point of sustained, determined action. [Samuel L. Boardman, ""Handbook of the Turf,"" New York, 1910] Related: Jogged; jogging. As a noun from 1610s."
