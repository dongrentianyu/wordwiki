"n.没有宗教信仰的人；异教徒 无 n. 没有宗教信仰的人; 异教徒(基督教等教徒以外的人) 【记】pa怕, gan干: 怕被基督教徒干掉的人－异教徒 【记】音：培根，培根是基督徒，又是现代科学思想的鼻祖，在当时基督教会斥责哥白尼等学说是不符合圣经的邪说时，培根亦被视是异教徒 (以此逻辑牛顿与许多同学的外国导师也是异教徒了:) ) 【相关】page 呼叫，听差，pager 传呼机 pagan (n.)  late 14c., from Late Latin paganus ""pagan,"" in classical Latin ""villager, rustic; civilian, non-combatant"" noun use of adjective meaning ""of the country, of a village,"" from pagus ""country people; province, rural district,"" originally ""district limited by markers,"" thus related to pangere ""to fix, fasten,"" from PIE root *pag- ""to fix"" (see pact). As an adjective from early 15c. Religious sense is often said to derive from conservative rural adherence to the old gods after the Christianization of Roman towns and cities; but the word in this sense predates that period in Church history, and it is more likely derived from the use of paganus in Roman military jargon for ""civilian, incompetent soldier,"" which Christians (Tertullian, c.202; Augustine) picked up with the military imagery of the early Church (such as milites ""soldier of Christ,"" etc.). Applied to modern pantheists and nature-worshippers from 1908."
