"adj. 狂怒的，疯狂的 【英】 adj. 狂怒的，疯狂的(viol ent or destructive rage or frenzy) 【记】 ber(穿)+serk(衣服sh irt), 原指古代斯堪的纳维 亚穿衣打仗的武士， 因为胆怯发疯 【例】 The berserk customer started pulling items off the shelf. adj. 狂暴的, 狂怒的(毁灭性的或狂乱地使用暴力的); 精神错乱的 【例】My husband will go berserk if he finds you here 要是我丈夫发觉你在这里, 他会气疯的. 【源】这个词都来自古老的斯堪的纳维亚语 berserkr, 意思是""quot;狂野的斗士""quot;. 这些斗士身穿熊皮, 所以berserkr这个词是由bera""quot;熊""quot;和serkr""quot;衬衫, 外套""quot;组成. 这些 berserkers在战斗中表现狂暴, 象动物一样吼叫, 口吐白沫, 口咬铁护甲. 【记】源自bear + shirt 身披熊皮的发狂斗士 berserk (adj.)  1844, from berserk (n.) ""Norse warrior,"" by 1835, an alternative form of berserker (1822), a word which was introduced by Sir Walter Scott, from Old Norse berserkr (n.) ""raging warrior of superhuman strength;"" probably from *ber- ""bear"" + serkr ""shirt,"" thus literally ""a warrior clothed in bearskin."" Thus not from Old Norse berr ""bare, naked."" Thorkelin, in the essay on the Berserkir, appended to his edition of the Krisini Saga, tells that an old name of the Berserk frenzy was hamremmi, i.e., strength acquired from another strange body, because it was anciently believed that the persons who were liable to this frenzy were mysteriously endowed, during its accesses, with a strange body of unearthly strength. If, however, the Berserk was called on by his own name, he lost his mysterious form, and his ordinary strength alone remained. [""Notes and Queries,"" Dec. 28, 1850]  The adjectival use probably is from such phrases as berserk frenzy, or as a title (Arngrim the Berserk)."
