But an early sense in Middle English also was ""stage or scene of a play"" (late 14c.) and Klein says a sense of Latin pagina was ""movable scaffold"" (probably from the etymological sense of ""stake""). With excrescent -t as in ancient (adj.). Generalized sense of ""showy parade, spectacle"" is first attested 1805, though this notion is found in pageantry (1650s)."
