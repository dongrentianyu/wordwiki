Perhaps ultimately related to crook and with an original notion of ""full of bends and turns"" (compare dialectal Swedish krik ""corner, bend; creek, cove""). Extended to ""inlet or short arm of a river"" by 1570s, which probably led to use for ""small stream, brook"" in American English (1620s). Also used there and in Canada, Australia, New Zealand for ""branch of a main river,"" possibly from explorers moving up main rivers and seeing and noting mouths of tributaries without knowing they often were extensive rivers of their own. Slang phrase up the creek ""in trouble,"" often especially ""pregnant,"" first recorded 1941, perhaps originally armed forces slang for ""lost while on patrol."" Creek  Indian tribe or confederation, 1725, named for creek, the geographical feature, and abbreviated from Ochese Creek Indians, from the place in Georgia where English first encountered them. Native name is Muskogee, a word of uncertain origin."
