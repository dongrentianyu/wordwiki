Some Old English and Old Norse forms suggest a compound meaning ""treason-worker,"" but there is no folk tale to explain or support this. lark (n.2)  ""spree, frolic,"" 1811, possibly shortening of skylark (1809), sailors' slang ""play rough in the rigging of a ship"" (larks were proverbial for high-flying), or from English dialectal lake/laik ""to play"" (c.1300, from Old Norse leika ""to play,"" from PIE *leig- ""to leap"") with intrusive -r- common in southern British dialect. The verb lake, considered characteristic of Northern English vocabulary, is the opposite of work but lacks the other meanings of play. As a verb, from 1813. Related: Larked; larking."
