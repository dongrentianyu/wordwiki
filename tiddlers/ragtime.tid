"n.拉格泰姆音乐；a.使人发笑的，滑稽的 无 n. 拉格泰姆音乐(美国黑人的切分乐曲) 【类】music: ragtime = ? 音乐: 拉格泰姆音乐 = ? 无 ragtime (n.)  also rag-time, ""syncopated, jazzy piano music,"" 1897, perhaps from rag ""dance ball"" (1895, American English dialect), or a shortening of ragged, in reference to the syncopated melody. Rag (n.) ""ragtime dance tune"" is from 1899. If rag-time was called tempo di raga or rague-temps it might win honor more speedily. ... What the derivation of the word is[,] I have not the faintest idea. The negroes call their clog-dancing ""ragging"" and the dance a ""rag."" [Rupert Hughes, Boston ""Musical Record,"" April 1900]  Conceive the futility of trying to reduce the intangible ragness to a strict system of misbegotten grace notes and untimely rests! In attempting to perfect, and simplify, art is destroying the unhampered spirit in which consists the whole beauty of rag-time music. The very essence of rag-time is that it shall lack all art, depending for the spirit to be infused more upon the performer than upon the composer himself. [""Yale Literary Magazine,"" June, 1899]  Her first ""rag-time"" was ""The Bully,"" in which she made great sport by bringing a little coloured boy on the stage with her. Miss [May] Irwin says the way to learn to sing ""rag-time"" is to catch a negro and study him. [Lewis C. Strang, ""Famous Actresses of the Day in America,"" Boston, 1899]"
