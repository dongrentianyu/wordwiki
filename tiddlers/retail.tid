"v.零售；n.零售 【英】 v. 零售 (to sell to the ultimate consumers); 【记】 re(再次)+tail(剪， 玩)→剪下来卖→零售; 【同】 参考：tailor(裁缝)派生词: retailer (n. 零售商) 【例】 At John's store, everything retails for less! 无 【记】源自re + tail cut，将大宗货物cut小了再来卖，如卖肉的 【相关】tailor 裁缝 (就是拿刀切衣服的) retail (v.)  mid-14c. ""sell in small quantities or parcels,"" from Old French retaillier ""cut back, cut off, pare, clip, reduce, circumcise,"" from re- ""back"" (see re-) + taillier ""to cut, trim"" (see tailor (n.)). Sometimes also ""to deal out (information, etc.) in small quantities; hand down by report; recount, tell over again"" (1590s). Related: Retailed; retailing. retail (n.)  early 15c., ""sale of commodities in small quantities or parcels or at second hand"" (opposed to wholesale), from Old French retail ""piece cut off, shred, scrap, paring"" (Modern French retaille), from retaillier (see retail (v.)). The notion of the English word is ""a selling by the piece."" This sense is not in French, however, and comes perhaps from cognate Italian ritaglio, which does have that sense. As an adjective, ""of or pertaining to sale at retail,"" c.1600."
