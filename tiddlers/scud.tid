""to move quickly,"" 1530s, of uncertain origin, perhaps a variant of Middle English scut ""rabbit, rabbit's tail,"" in reference to its movements (see scut (n.1)), but there are phonetic difficulties. Perhaps rather from a North Sea Germanic source akin to Middle Low German, Middle Dutch schudden ""to shake"" (see quash). Related: Scudded; scudding. As a noun from c.1600, from the verb.
